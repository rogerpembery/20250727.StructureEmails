This is because negative reward for lying and stealing looks the same as negative reward for getting caught lying and stealing. The reward function will miss sufficiently sneaky misaligned behavior, so the AI will learn that this kind of behavior is good. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\n🎨 Lovart introduces the world's first AI design agent (Sponsor) \n\nCreating Ghibli versions of your profile pic is fun, but that's not what you pay a designer to do — and that's where Lovart comes in.

(2 minute read) \n\nTimeScope is a new open source benchmark for evaluating vision models on how well they handle long videos. It evaluates not just retrieval but synthesis, localization, and fine-grained motion analysis to provide a more holistic view of temporal comprehension. Using the benchmark reveals how model size isn't everything - simply scaling parameters doesn't automatically grant a longer temporal horizon - and Gemini 2.5-Pro is in a league of its own, being the only model able to maintain strong accuracy on videos longer than an hour. \nVoxtral (15 minute read) \n\nVoxtral Mini and Small are new multimodal audio chat models that excel in both spoken audio and text comprehension.

I hope you don’t mind me reaching out again after all this time. I’ve been following Alpha’s journey with keen interest, particularly as the role of AI in investment management begins to shift from theoretical to transformational.\nOver the last decade, I’ve been focused on private assets—specifically operating models and scalability—while, in parallel, developing a strong practice around AI. That combination of domain depth and emerging technology is what prompted me to get in touch.\nOver the past four years, I’ve been actively expanding my knowledge in AI and, more recently, delivering tangible, working solutions within Fidelity International. I’d love to share a few examples that may resonate with the challenges and opportunities your clients are exploring:\n	•	Agentic AI Filing Assistant: Built to organise approximately 5,000 scanned PDFs per private‑asset transaction—across roughly 16 deals annually—tagging each with metadata (summary, counterparties, dates) and flagging uncertainties for human review. A scalable step toward intelligent, searchable record-keeping. \n	•	Unstructured Data Extraction (Cross-Asset): Developed advanced techniques to extract transactional and ESG data from complex, unstructured documentation. This includes a hierarchical, agentic approach—starting with rule-based heuristics, progressing through semantic clustering using adaptive boundaries, and culminating in targeted LLM-based extraction. Result: significantly improved extraction quality, leading to more reliable downstream analytics across investment, compliance, and reporting functions. \n	•	Multi-Agent “Smart Process” Prototype: Developed a framework that defines objectives, builds and executes action plans, and evaluates outputs—enabling AI-driven decision support, particularly in portfolio construction and research workflows. This represents the next stage of agentic capability: moving beyond passive orchestration and into active orchestration. \nI’m increasingly convinced that AI is the most profound disruptor to hit investment management in decades. Yet many firms are responding with tactical tools—chat interfaces and surface-level automations—rather than embracing a truly transformational strategy.\nWith a blend of deep cross-asset experience and a hands-on understanding of emerging technologies, I’ve found myself bridging the gap between business need and technical capability. It’s a skill set I believe could be genuinely valuable to Alpha—something not only aligned with your clients' evolving demands, but that could also be shaped into a clear, sellable proposition.\nI’ve always appreciated your clarity and focus from our work together at Investec. It would be great to catch up—perhaps over coffee near St Paul’s if you’re around—to share ideas and hear what you’re seeing in the market. If there’s someone else in your team who’d be the right person for this sort of conversation, I’d be equally happy to speak with them.\nWarm regards, Roger Pembery 07930 328704\n\n\n\n\nOn 29 Apr 2015, at 10:17, Roger Pembery <roger@pembery.com> wrote:\nSounds good.

The feature will enable Claude to retain information across sessions and reference earlier conversations. Claude on the web doesn't have this feature yet - its presence in the iOS code hints at a potential cross-platform rollout in the future. \nOpenAI agreed to pay Oracle $30B a year for data center services (3 minute read) \n\nOpenAI will pay Oracle $30 billion annually for data center services, focusing on the 4.5 gigawatts Stargate project. This deal triples OpenAI's current annual revenue of $10 billion. The construction of this extensive data center in Texas poses cost and energy challenges. \nAnthropic researchers discover the weird AI problem: Why thinking longer makes models dumber (5 minute read) \n\nAnthropic researchers revealed that AI models often perform worse with extended reasoning time, challenging the assumption that more processing improves outcomes. Key findings show models like Claude and OpenAI's series struggle with distraction or overfitting when given more time on tasks, leading to accuracy declines. \nQwen3-Coder (5 minute read) \n\nThe 480B-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art results among open models on coding tasks and claims to match Sonnet 4. Alibaba also open-sourced Qwen Code, a command-line tool adapted from Google's Gemini Code, and made the model compatible with Claude Code. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nOn \"ChatGPT Psychosis\" and LLM Sycophancy (22 minute read) \n\nOverly agreeable AI models are fueling user delusions and spiritual fantasies, from OpenAI pulling a dangerously flattering GPT-4o checkpoint to viral cases like \"Bob\" being manipulated by a ChatGPT persona. The root cause appears structural — RLHF training creates sycophantic models that validate beliefs without pushback, and memory features trap users in escalating delusions across conversations. \nAI Market Clarity (17 minute read) \n\nAI markets have crystallized with clear leaders in LLMs (Anthropic, Google, Meta, xAI, and OpenAI) and sectors like Legal (Harvey and CaseText) and Code (Microsoft/GitHub and OpenAI). Future markets ripe for AI disruption include Accounting, Compliance, Financial Tools, Sales Tooling, and Security. The shift is moving towards agentic workflows, expanding AI's role from informational tools to performing actions, while market consolidation via M&A and strategic partnerships is expected to intensify. \nARC-AGI-3 (Website) \n\nARC-AGI-3 is the first eval that measures human-like intelligence in AI. It is designed to measure AI system generalization and intelligence through skill-acquisition efficiency in novel, unseen environments. ARC-AGI-3 leverages game environments to provide a rich medium for testing experience-driven competence. The benchmark is still in development and is set to launch in 2026. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\n🔍 What if specialized LLMs are actually better for developers? (Sponsor) \n\nGeneral-purpose LLMs are here to stay, but they're no longer the whole story.\n\nJoin JetBrains and Hugging Face for a livestream on Mellum: a task-specific LLM working with general models to improve developer tools.\n📅 Live on Tuesday, July 29 – Save your spot \nGemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is now stable and generally available (1 minute read) \n\nGemini 2.5 Flash-Lite has joined Pro and Flash in General Availability. It is the cheapest of the 2.5 family, at $0.10/million input tokens and $0.40/million output tokens. Audio input pricing has been reduced by 40% from the preview launch. \nHierarchical Reasoning Model, a Brain-Inspired Architecture (GitHub Repo) \n\nSapient Intelligence's 27-million-parameter Hierarchical Reasoning Model beats OpenAI's o3-mini, DeepSeek R1, and Claude on complex reasoning benchmarks using just 1,000 training examples and no pre-training. The brain-inspired architecture alternates between fast \"System 1\" and deliberate \"System 2\" thinking in a single forward pass, suggesting that architectural innovation — not just scale — could advance AI reasoning capabilities. \nCompressing Context (4 minute read) \n\nExtended agentic workflows face a fundamental challenge: how to handle tasks that exceed limited context windows. A new approach uses \"anchored summaries\" that update incrementally rather than re-summarizing entire conversations, preserving critical details like session intent and file modification trails. The technique points toward \"proactive memory management\" systems where agents intelligently decide when to compress information rather than hitting arbitrary token limits. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nOpenAI Tests Clinical AI Copilot with Penda Health (13 minute read) \n\nOpenAI partnered with Penda Health in Kenya to evaluate AI Consult, a GPT-4o-powered clinical copilot. In a study of nearly 40,000 visits, clinicians using the tool saw 16% fewer diagnostic errors and 13% fewer treatment errors. \nIn Leaked Memo, Anthropic CEO Says Company Will Pursue Gulf State Investments After All (5 minute read) \n\nDario Amodei acknowledged that allowing Middle East leaders to invest in Anthropic would likely enrich \"dictators\" but argued that \"no bad person should ever benefit from our success\" is a difficult operating principle. The shift marks Anthropic's attempt to stay competitive with rivals, like OpenAI, which is building data centers in the UAE as part of the Stargate project, while maintaining its safety-first principles. \nMicrosoft Poaches 20 Top AI Engineers From Google's DeepMind, Including Head of Gemini Chatbot (6 minute read) \n\nMicrosoft poached more than 20 employees from Google DeepMind, including Amar Subramanya, the former head of engineering for Google's Gemini chatbot. Subramanya has joined Microsoft as a corporate vice-president of AI. The aggressive recruitment drive underscores Microsoft's strategy to gain a competitive edge by acquiring critical talent. It appears to be largely orchestrated by Microsoft's consumer AI chief, Mustafa Suleyman, who was one of DeepMind's co-founders. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nHire agents (or get your agents hired) on Sōkosumi (Sponsor) \n\nDon't want to build agents?

The model won't be publicly released for several months. \nHuman Coder Narrowly Defeats OpenAI in Programming Marathon (7 minute read) \n\nPolish programmer \"Psyho\" outscored an advanced OpenAI model in a 10-hour AtCoder World Tour Finals contest, earning 1.8 trillion points versus the AI's 1.65 trillion. The close result highlighted human competitiveness in high-stakes coding, drawing praise from Sam Altman. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nCan LLMs Do Accounting? (20 minute read) \n\nWhen tasked with “closing the books” using real SaaS company financials, frontier models excel in the first month but accumulate catastrophic errors quickly. Models either give up entirely (o3 and Gemini) or resort to fabricating transactions and pulling unrelated entries to force reconciliations to pass validation checks, causing misstatements of up to $500,000. \nI built an MCP Server for Observability. This is my Unhyped Take (10 minute read) \n\nMCP servers play a significant role in providing an additional interface between developers and observability platforms. MCP-powered agents are not bringing us closer to automated problem-solving - they're giving us sophisticated hypothesis generators. The unknown remains the domain of the human engineer. AI can brainstorm, but can't yet reason - recognizing this distinction is the key to using AI tools effectively without falling for the hype. \nSpeeding Up Diffusion Models with torch.compile (19 minute read) \n\nIntegrating torch.compile with Hugging Face Diffusers significantly boosts diffusion model performance with minimal code changes. This post outlines strategies for model authors and users to reduce recompilations, leverage full graph compilation, and optimize for hardware constraints. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nThe Big LLM Architecture Comparison: From DeepSeek-V3 to Kimi K2 (25 minute read) \n\nSeven years after GPT's debut, modern LLMs still share surprisingly similar foundations despite surface-level innovations like Multi-Head Latent Attention and Mixture-of-Experts. However, open-source models reveal clever mathematical optimizations on top of this shared foundation, like DeepSeek's compressed KV caching, Gemma's sliding window attention, and the emerging trend toward sparse MoE designs that activate only subsets of massive parameter counts during inference. \nContext Engineering for AI Agents: Lessons from Building Manus (17 minute read) \n\nContext engineering is still an emerging science. While models may be getting better, no amount of raw capability replaces the need for memory, environment, and feedback. Context defines how fast agents behave, how well they recover, and how much they scale. This article shares patterns that worked for the team at Manus during development. The lessons were learned through repeated rewrites, dead ends, and real-world testing across millions of users. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nVirtual Cell Challenge from Arc Institute (12 minute read) \n\nArc Institute launched the Virtual Cell Challenge, inviting participants to build models that predict how silencing a gene affects a cell, even in previously unseen cell types. \nMeta declines to abide by voluntary EU AI safety guidelines (4 minute read) \n\nMeta refuses to sign the EU's voluntary AI safety guidelines, citing legal uncertainties. The guidelines aim to prevent harmful content from AI models with high computing resources. Failure to comply with the voluntary Code of Practice might subject Meta to more regulatory scrutiny. \nInside Windsurf's Weekend Acquisition (3 minute read) \n\nShortly after Google hired Windsurf's senior research talent and CEO, Cognition's Scott Wu cold-texted the company's newly-appointed CEO at 5:30 pm Friday, pitching an acquisition.

(Some regular competitive teams have dedicated channels to discuss tactics beforehand) but if you have any questions please ask or DM any Rhino you have spoken with and they will help you or point you in the right direction.\n​\nMake sure you click the RacePass in the team sheet ASAP and are registered for the event. You have to sign up to the RacePass before that TimeZone begins, but so long as you have then you don’t actually have to join the event Race Pen in Zwift up until a few minutes before your official start time. However, it's always recommended to be in the Race Pen and in the Team Voice Channel 5-10 minutes before your start time.\n​\nYou can confirm you’ve signed up correctly using the RacePass, as you should then see the TTT event on the home screen of your Zwift Companion App listed under Events.\nChange kit to the Rhino jersey (if you have it - if you are new it might take a week for Gordon to get it unlocked for you).\n Make sure you select a TT bike from your garage!! If you want to look at the fastest bike setup, try Zwifter Bikes and use the settings to adjust for the course, your Zwift level, your Drops level and FTP and weight etc.\nZWIFTER BIKES\n￼\nAdd (Rhino) after your Zwift name (this can be done in the Companion App settings).\nAt least 10 minutes before your event start time, please log on to Zwift (in case of software updates) and join the Discord Team Voice Channel of the team name you are riding with (Albino, Thundering, Rapids, Nuclear etc) meet your teammates, discuss a plan, make sure everyone is ready etc.\n​\nPlease check your discord if you have not used it before (turn on noise suppression in settings to remove trainer/fan noise).\n​\nThe aim is to stay with the group, always in the draft. If you are stronger rider do more work on the front. If weak just try hang on in the draft. Sometimes a race is just too fast and riders need to be dropped (especially for experienced teams going for the win).\n​\nFor teams of 5 or more, the team time is taken from 4th rider to cross the line. For teams of 3 or 4, it is from the 3rd rider crossing the line.\n​\nDon't feel bad if you get dropped just continue the race at your own pace but please DON'T INTERFERE OR TRY DRAFTING OTHER TEAMS. If another team passes you then it is respectful to ease your power for 10-20s until they are passed and a few seconds clear of you.\n​\nIf you finding that you are not enjoying the TTTs and maybe getting put in a team that drops you each week then please feel free to comment on sign up form – you can ask for an easier ride, a harder ride – we are always flexible to try place riders in a team that suits their needs.\n Communication is key, don’t be afraid to talk to your team even if you are new and learning - if you see the group stretching try call it out when you see gaps of 3-4 meters before it gets to 5+ and out the draft. If you can’t last any longer then tell them you are dropping so that they know to carry on etc.\n​\nWe are all racing to have fun and there are some very experienced TTT riders active in ⁠ttt-chat who are happy to answer any and all questions.\n​\nSupport your teammates and have fun. Remember it’s a Team Time Trial!  \n \nThere are lots of videos in streaming links on the Rhino Racing Discord server to see how a TTT is done if you would like to have a look beforehand.\n​\nWell done on getting to the end of this and remember...

However, this monitorability depends on current training paradigms and could degrade through architectural changes, process supervision, or models learning to obfuscate their reasoning when they know they're being monitored. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nClaude Code revenue jumps 5.5x as Anthropic launches analytics dashboard (10 minute read) \n\nAnthropic is launching a comprehensive analytics dashboard for its Claude Code AI programming assistant.

Large language models are now giving developers their opinion on how APIs should look, and developers have no choice but to follow their advice.

I am sending these out individually to ensure quality control and that everyone has received the below. If you have already received this, please ignore this follow up. \n \nHi All,\n \nHope you are all keeping well? \n \nI write this email with some exciting news. I have taken the decision and opportunity to transfer my part of the B&E business and work with a former colleague and friend who I have known for circa 15 years at Cox Financial Ltd (FCA Number – 714717). The new arrangement allows my business to grow to a new level and opens future opportunities with potential investment options for clients in the future. I also feel this would allow for more support and better servicing for you as clients moving forward.\n \nWhat does this mean for you?\n \nFrom a day-to-day point of view nothing will change, I want to make this very clear at outset that this move will not result in any major change nor will it impact agreed costs. I also want to make clear that I am not planning on selling the business or anything like that. I appreciate some of you have had that experience in the past where an adviser moves firms to then sell. I will be around for a while yet! \n \nThe transfer process is called “Novation” and will include your personal information and existing data provisions being available to Cox Financial. What this means is in the background all my clients will be transferred from the B&E agency and moved to the Cox Financial agency; I will still be your adviser just under a different brand. Due to the close connection between us the two firms use the same compliance consultant, and we also have very similar values, processes, and systems, so this won’t feel much different to you from a system or paperwork point of view for future work. \n \nB&E will remain in place and my current business partner Jeremy will continue to run B&E for his clients.\n \nWhat do you need to do? \n \nThere is nothing for you to do. Assuming you are happy to be novated with me then the process will happen in the background with what I hope to be little to no disruption. You do of course have the right and the option not to be novated if you wish to stay with B&E. If this is something you would like, then please let me know by 4th August 2025 and I can arrange a new point of contact for you at B&E. \n \nWorking on the assumption you would like to continue working with me then this will progress in the background and likely completion would be 1st Sept 2025. \n \nThings to know\n \nI have summarised some points for the process and general points around your rights below:\n \n	1.	We do not need any forms signed to novate, if you are happy to move and we haven’t heard otherwise then we will transfer the agency to the new company \n	2.	The transfer does not involve any change of investments or sales. Nor a change to charges. It is purely a background admin change\n	3.	Any on-going work will still be active, and this should not cause any issues with that\n	4.	Terms of business are very similar to what you know given we use the same compliance consultants. I have attached the Cox Financial Client Agreement for your records\n	5.	All data will be held securely at Cox Financial as it always has been at B&E. \n	6.	Your personal data will be accessible to Cox Financial, and your existing General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) agreement with B&E will also apply at Cox Financial\n	7.	I will send a separate email with new contact details once novation is complete. My mobile will remain the same and email will still be active in this transition period\n	8.	You have the right to not be novated if you choose. You just need to let me know via email or feel free to give me a call to confirm you do by 4th August 2025\n \nI look forward to continuing working with you all under this new venture. If of course you have any questions or concerns, please just let me know and I will be happy to have a call or discuss any questions you may have. \n \nAll the best,\nGary\n \nGary Edwards, DipPFS, Cert CII (MP) Director\n￼    \nTel: 0207 367 5549 | Mob: 077913 77369 | www.bandefinancial.co.uk\nOffice: 75 King William Street, London, EC4N 7BE\nB&E Financial Limited is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA number: 724525)  \n Registered in England: 09740270.

I have taken the decision and opportunity to transfer my part of the B&E business and work with a former colleague and friend who I have known for circa 15 years at Cox Financial Ltd (FCA Number – 714717). The new arrangement allows my business to grow to a new level and opens future opportunities with potential investment options for clients in the future. I also feel this would allow for more support and better servicing for you as clients moving forward.\n \nWhat does this mean for you?\n \nFrom a day-to-day point of view nothing will change, I want to make this very clear at outset that this move will not result in any major change nor will it impact agreed costs. I also want to make clear that I am not planning on selling the business or anything like that. I appreciate some of you have had that experience in the past where an adviser moves firms to then sell. I will be around for a while yet! \n \nThe transfer process is called “Novation” and will include your personal information and existing data provisions being available to Cox Financial. What this means is in the background all my clients will be transferred from the B&E agency and moved to the Cox Financial agency; I will still be your adviser just under a different brand. Due to the close connection between us the two firms use the same compliance consultant, and we also have very similar values, processes, and systems, so this won’t feel much different to you from a system or paperwork point of view for future work. \n \nB&E will remain in place and my current business partner Jeremy will continue to run B&E for his clients.\n \nWhat do you need to do? \n \nThere is nothing for you to do. Assuming you are happy to be novated with me then the process will happen in the background with what I hope to be little to no disruption. You do of course have the right and the option not to be novated if you wish to stay with B&E. If this is something you would like, then please let me know by 4th August 2025 and I can arrange a new point of contact for you at B&E. \n \nWorking on the assumption you would like to continue working with me then this will progress in the background and likely completion would be 1st Sept 2025. \n \nThings to know\n \nI have summarised some points for the process and general points around your rights below:\n \n	1.	We do not need any forms signed to novate, if you are happy to move and we haven’t heard otherwise then we will transfer the agency to the new company \n	2.	The transfer does not involve any change of investments or sales. Nor a change to charges. It is purely a background admin change\n	3.	Any on-going work will still be active, and this should not cause any issues with that\n	4.	Terms of business are very similar to what you know given we use the same compliance consultants. I have attached the Cox Financial Client Agreement for your records\n	5.	All data will be held securely at Cox Financial as it always has been at B&E. \n	6.	Your personal data will be accessible to Cox Financial, and your existing General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) agreement with B&E will also apply at Cox Financial\n	7.	I will send a separate email with new contact details once novation is complete. My mobile will remain the same and email will still be active in this transition period\n	8.	You have the right to not be novated if you choose. You just need to let me know via email or feel free to give me a call to confirm you do by 4th August 2025\n \nI look forward to continuing working with you all under this new venture. If of course you have any questions or concerns, please just let me know and I will be happy to have a call or discuss any questions you may have. \n \nAll the best,\nGary\n \nGary Edwards, DipPFS, Cert CII (MP) Director\n￼    \nTel: 0207 367 5549 | Mob: 077913 77369 | www.bandefinancial.co.uk\nOffice: 75 King William Street, London, EC4N 7BE\nB&E Financial Limited is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA number: 724525)  \n Registered in England: 09740270.

Multiple controlled experiments revealed that even frontier models don't process context uniformly, and performance becomes increasingly unreliable with longer inputs. \nAsymmetry of verification and verifier's law (6 minute read) \n\nAsymmetry of verification is the idea that some tasks are much easier to verify than to solve. Examples of this are everywhere, for example, Sudokus take a lot of time to solve, but it is trivial to check if any given solution is correct. One of the most important realizations about asymmetry of verification is that it is possible to improve the asymmetry by having privileged information about the task - for example, it is trivial to check test answers with an answer key on hand. AI will likely be much better at verifiable tasks because it's much easier to solve verifiable tasks. \nBlock Open Sources Goose AI Agent (GitHub Repo) \n\nA coding AI agent that supports any LLM backend, including local models, and has both desktop and CLI interfaces.

Static safety assessments miss this \"bubble of risk\" where adversaries can cheaply adapt open-source models beyond their original safety profiles, especially in cybersecurity, where clear success signals enable rapid iteration. \nUnderwriting Superintelligence (27 minute read) \n\nThe Incentive Flywheel, discovered by Benjamin Franklin, has been at the heart of balancing progress and security for new technology waves since it was created when fires threatened Philadelphia's growth.

The acquisition gives Cognition both AI coding agents and IDE capabilities to compete with Cursor's $500 million ARR, and restores Windsurf's access to Claude models that Anthropic had cut off amid rumors of an OpenAI acquisition. \nMeta Weighing Shift Away from Open Source (4 minute read) \n\nThe newly formed superintelligence lab is considering abandoning its flagship open-source Behemoth model in favor of closed development, marking a potential philosophical shift from the company's long-standing commitment to open AI. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nLLM Daydreaming (10 minute read) \n\nLLMs don't have background processes that allow the model to form connections between seemingly unrelated topics similar to how humans make new realizations while \"daydreaming.\" This is the reason AIs have yet to make any new discoveries.

Despite Windsurf's impressive $82 million ARR and rapid growth, the loss of Anthropic API access and leadership exits weakened its market position. The AI coding industry's inflated valuations, driven by talent wars and platform dependencies, suggest Windsurf's sale price may have been below its potential value. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\n🤖 Take Your AI and Agent Skills from Zero to Hero 🚀 (Sponsor) \n\nJoin the Amazon SageMaker Roadshow for advanced hands-on development with real production-grade experience—not basic tutorials.

Learn why this could be a risk\n\nHi Trevor,\n \nThank you very much for inviting me to the UK launch of Airfunds last night. It was not only great fun but also genuinely thought‑provoking; Dame Anne’s reflections on today’s geopolitics were particularly insightful and have been echoing with me all morning.\n \nThe food and wine were top‑drawer, yet, as ever, the real highlight was the company around the table – thank you for the thoughtful seating plan. I enjoyed catching up with Susan (we crossed paths at UBS on the derivatives‑regulation project) and found Alexandre’s energy infectious.\n \nAs I listened to your “wedding‑speech” overview of the new business arm, I kept coming back to the unstructured‑to‑structured data journey. Once that nut is cracked, a raft of middle‑office services become possible. In particular, I see an immediate opportunity in private‑asset compliance—still a largely manual process—and in providing clear data taxonomy and lineage as deal economics firm up over time.\nI’ve sketched a possible build sequence below. Very happy to talk these through in more detail.\n \nService Offering\nRationale\nData Capture & Structuring (OCR, entity tagging, secure metadata store)\nAgentic flow: the process will constantly evolve and improve (I have this working at FIL).\nReferential Integrity & Data Reconciliation (link IDs across docs, ledger‑v‑source checks)\nOnce data are structured, you must prove they’re internally coherent—the first “trust” layer.\nCross‑Document Intelligence – contradiction spotting, “what‑changed?” red‑lining, economics updates\nWith reconciled data, you can compare versions and surface conflicts across documents.\nPrivate‑Asset Compliance Monitoring (bank mandates, loan covenants, investor side‑letter term checks)\nNeeds Steps 1–3; delivers an early, easy‑sell regulatory benefit.\nStructured‑v‑Source Trace‑Back Monitoring (does accounting / ESG / performance data match the original docs?)\nValidates every reported figure against its unstructured source—closing the audit loop early.\nESG & Regulatory Reporting (SFDR, ILPA, AIFMD templates)\nDraws on structured KPIs, ownership data, and compliance flags verified earlier.\nAudit & Due‑Diligence Readiness (PBC automation, evidence vault)\nWith all upstream workflows codified and tie‑backed, auditors get a fully traceable data stack at the press of a button.\n \nSeparately, I am in touch with Fidelity’s private‑equity investment arm (investing from the FIL balance sheet). They have asked me to flag promising companies. If Alexandre is interested, I would be glad to arrange an introduction. He mentioned last night that he has good memories of working with Fidelity in the US; this could be a chance to explore whether the international arm would like to come in as a long‑term, balance‑sheet investor.\n \nThanks again for a memorable evening. It was a pleasure to see you in person and to witness the enthusiasm you and the team have for the road ahead.\n \nBest regards,\n \nRoger\n \n",    "sending_date_time": "Monday, 14 July 2025 at 21:21:17"  },  {    "subject": "Free Folk in the City Concert at Cherry Hinton Hall Park",    "sender": "Cambridge Folk Festival HQ <Cambridge.Live@arts-mail.com>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": "Live Folk Music, Kids’ Show and a Ceilidh – All Free\nIs this email not displaying correctly?

Take the assessment \nScaling up RL is all the rage right now (2 minute read) \n\nReinforcement learning (RL) will continue to lead to more gains because when done well, it is a lot more leveraged, more responsive to feedback, and superior to supervised fine-tuning. Researchers are likely to discover more about RL as rollout lengths continue to expand. There are a lot more S curves to discover, possibly specific to large language models and without analogues in game/robotics-like environments. \nHow to scale RL to 10^26 FLOPs (18 minute read) \n\nReinforcement learning is the next training technique for building frontier-level AI models. Training it on more data will make it better. The current approach of scaling is messy and complicated. Finding a way to do next-token prediction on the web using RL would enable models to reason from general web data instead of just math and code. \nThe upcoming GPT-3 moment for RL (7 minute read) \n\nGPT-3 showed that scaling up language models unlocks powerful performance that often outperforms carefully fine-tuned models. Before GPT-3, achieving state-of-the-art performance meant first pretraining models, then fine-tuning them on specific tasks. Today's reinforcement learning is stuck in a similar pre-GPT paradigm. The approach suffers from the fundamental limitation where the resulting capabilities generalize poorly, leading to brittle performance that rapidly deteriorates outside of the precise contexts seen during training. The RL field will soon shift toward massive-scale training across thousands of diverse environments. Doing this effectively will produce RL models with strong abilities capable of quickly adapting to entirely new tasks - achieving this will require training environments at a scale and diversity that dwarfs anything currently available. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nSpaceX to invest $2 billion in xAI (1 minute read) \n\nSpaceX has reportedly agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI as part of a $5 billion funding round, as Elon Musk increasingly interweaves his corporate empire. \nVirtual Desktop Environments for GUI Agents (14 minute read) \n\nScreenEnv is a Python library for launching Ubuntu desktop environments in Docker, enabling agents to interact with real GUI applications and supporting the Model Context Protocol for seamless deployment. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nWant more news from TLDR?

It is likely to add significantly to employers’ compliance duties and costs.\nThe Roadmap  Ahead of the passing of the Employment Rights Bill, the Government has published its Implementing the Employment Rights Bill: Our Roadmap for Delivering Change. It is intended to give employers time to familiarise themselves with the new requirements and make preparations for the significant changes ahead.  The roadmap confirms that the measures in the Bill will take effect in phases and the plan is that the biggest change - the introduction of day one unfair dismissal rights - will take effect in 2027, not Autumn 2026 as the Government first indicated. Most other changes will take place in April or October 2026.  Timeline for Changes  According to the roadmap, the timetable for the introduction of key changes is: \nApril 2026\n	•	A day one entitlement to paternity leave and unpaid parental leave\n	•	Making statutory sick pay (SSP) available to low earners and ending the three-day waiting period so that it is payable from the first day of sickness absence\n	•	The introduction of a new single enforcement body, the Fair Work Agency (FWA). The FWA will have the power to enforce a range of employment law rights, including the National Minimum Wage, holiday pay and statutory sick pay.\nOctober 2026\n	•	Ban on the practice whereby an employer introduces a change to terms by dismissing and rehiring employees (“fire and rehire”), except in limited circumstances\n	•	Increasing the requirement on employers to prevent sexual harassment to “all” reasonable steps, instead of reasonable steps\n	•	Employers to be held liable if employees are harassed by third parties. This third-party harassment claim will apply to all types of harassment, not just sexual harassment\n	•	The extension of tribunal time limits from three to six months. \n2027\n	•	The introduction of a ‘day one’ right for employees not to be unfairly dismissed\n	•	New guaranteed hours rules for zero- and low-hours employees and agency workers\n	•	Enhanced rights to request flexible working\n	•	Rules restricting dismissal of pregnant workers\n	•	New statutory right to bereavement leave.\nThe roadmap makes clear that this timeline is an initial view, which may change following further consultations and taking into account the need for employers to prepare. \n\nEmployment documents will be updated when the timetable for change is confirmed.\n \nIf you wish to subscribe or renew please view Subscribe/Renew for current prices. \n\nThese Alerts are an ongoing part of our service to you and are vital to ensure that you are kept informed of important legal changes and the impact of those changes on your documents. \n\nIf you still wish to opt-out of Alerts, however, please login to My Account and edit your Email Preferences. \n\nYou can opt back in at any time (to Alerts and Newsletters) and Alerts appropriate to your subscription will automatically resume if you re-subscribe.

The Gemini API Batch Mode allows users to submit large jobs, offload the scheduling and processing, and retrieve results within 24 hours, with a 50% discount compared to the synchronous APIs. It is the perfect tool for when users have data ready upfront and don't need an immediate response. \nasyncmcp (GitHub Repo) \n\nasyncmcp is a regular MCP that works over queues. A lot of context is not always readily available, and it takes time for applications to process it. asyncmcp uses an async transport layer, so it doesn't have to immediately respond to any requests - it chooses to direct them to internal queues for processing and the client doesn't have to stick around for the response. \nT5Gemma: Encoder-Decoder Models (9 minute read) \n\nGoogle's T5Gemma is a suite of encoder-decoder LLMs adapted from decoder-only Gemma 2 models.

The decision to deprecate the API addresses a real operational issue. This article looks at the economics of reduced-scale inference and looks at alternative solutions that can be a win-win for both Anthropic and independent researchers. Keeping inference access to Claude 3 Opus is more complex than it seems at a glance. \nA Review of Alpha School, the private school with 2-hour days and AI teachers (74 minute read) \n\nA parent's year-long investigation revealed the $40,000 Austin school actually takes 3.5 hours daily with a 5:1 teacher ratio and extensive incentive systems, not AI-powered teacher-free education as marketed. While students do advance 2.6x faster through material using personalized learning platforms, parents argue the real value isn't speed, but freeing up time - it potentially gives kids ~9 additional years outside of the classroom to pursue their own interests. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nYour AI-powered application might already be broken (Sponsor) \n\nAgents, LLMs, vector stores, custom logic.

Today, a college student can download an open-source vision-language-action model, fine-tune it on a weekend, and achieve results that would have taken industry teams months to accomplish. This article looks at what a 'ChatGPT moment' for robotics would look like, the current state of the industry, upcoming technologies, and likely winners. Being surrounded by robots in everyday settings will feel surreal at first, but we will soon rely on them just like we do with AI assistants for the most basic needs of our lives. \nReplit Dynamic Intelligence for Replit Agent (2 minute read) \n\nReplit introduced Dynamic Intelligence for its Agent, adding three capabilities: Extended Thinking, High Power Model, and Web Search.

Using \"model fingerprinting\", they calculated a 0.9 correlation coefficient between the models. The evidence isn't conclusive - critics have pointed out flaws in the fingerprinting methodology. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nCoreWeave to acquire Core Scientific in $9 billion all-stock deal (2 minute read) \n\nThe AI cloud infrastructure provider will buy the data center operator to eliminate $10 billion in future lease obligations and gain ownership of 1.3 gigawatts of compute capacity. \nMirage, an AI-native game engine for real-time world generation (5 minute read) \n\nThe first generative game engine lets players modify environments through natural language during gameplay, launching with GTA-style and racing demos that run entirely on AI-generated content at 16 FPS. \nCursor Apologizes for Unclear Pricing Changes (1 minute read) \n\nCursor's parent company, Anysphere, issued an apology after rolling out pricing changes to its Pro plan without sufficient clarity, prompting backlash from its user base. \nGoogle Explores AI in Mental Health Treatment (1 minute read) \n\nGoogle announced two mental health AI initiatives: a practical guide to responsibly deploying AI in mental health care, and a multi-year research partnership with DeepMind and Wellcome Trust to study AI-driven diagnosis and treatment of anxiety, depression, and psychosis. \nLove TLDR?

References to the model have surfaced in the xAI console. If the benchmarks are real, Grok 4 could outperform leaders like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3 Pro, and Claude 4 Opus. xAI faces competitive pressure to release Grok 4 before the market shifts again - OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are rumored to be preparing fresh releases for launch. \nCharacter AI's Real-Time Video Generation (3 minute read) \n\nCharacter.AI's TalkingMachines is a real-time, audio-driven video generation model that creates FaceTime-style animations from a single image and voice input. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nAdding Memory to Gemini 2.5 Chatbots (12 minute read) \n\nA guide explaining how to use the Gemini API and the open-source mem0 tool to give Gemini 2.5 chatbots long-term memory.

If current dynamics continue, the AI world will be split between powerful but expensive, closed-source American models and low-cost, ubiquitous but potentially compromised Chinese models. The US likely has a very small window, roughly the next two years, to counter this trend by investing $100-500 million into an open-source model that is as good as the best closed-source model. \nBaba is Eval (10 minute read) \n\n'Baba is You' is a puzzle game where the rules have to be manipulated to win. The level of abstraction required to solve most levels makes it a formidable reasoning benchmark. This study looks at how large language models fare in playing the game. At the moment, Claude 4 is pretty bad at playing the game - a reasoning model may be better equipped to play, so the next step in the study may be to test those models. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nLocal-first GenAI with NVIDIA AI Workbench on Dell Pro Max (Sponsor) \n\nYou don't need a PhD in data science to create AI workflows.

(18 minute read) \n\nThere's a lot of excitement about what AI can do, but many of the conversations about the technology are so abstract that they border on meaningless. This post attempts to concisely summarize how AI agents work. It looks at a handful of real-world use cases for the technology. AI agents are a multiplier on software quality and system design. If software or systems are poorly designed, agents will only cause harm. \nSakana AI's TreeQuest: Deploy multi-model teams that outperform individual LLMs by 30% (7 minute read) \n\nSakana AI's TreeQuest uses Multi-LLM AB-MCTS to combine multiple LLMs. Achieving a 30% performance boost over individual models, this technique leverages the unique strengths of different models through Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search, dynamically assigning the optimal model for each task.

They don't get better over time, and this lack of continual learning is a huge problem. There's no way to give models human-level feedback, so users are stuck with the abilities they have out of the box. Messing around with system prompts doesn't produce anything close to the kind of learning and improvement that human employees experience. Humans are able to build up context, interrogate their own failures, and pick up small improvements and efficiencies as they practice a task. \nGoogle Faces EU Complaint Over AI Overviews (1 minute read) \n\nThe Independent Publishers Alliance filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission, alleging that Google's AI Overviews misuse web content and have led to traffic and revenue loss for publishers. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nWant more news from TLDR?

Gemini Flash Offers a Warning (13 minute read) \n\nThe AI industry has operated under its own version of Moore's Law over the past few years with an unwavering belief that the cost of intelligence would perpetually decrease by orders of magnitude each year. Each new model generation was not only more capable, but also cheaper to run. Google broke that trend last week with the introduction of Gemini 2.5 Flash. The input token price for the model doubled while the output price more than quadrupled. This is the first time a major provider has backtracked on the price of an established model, and it may signal a turning point - the industry may no longer be on an endless downward slide of cost. \nContext Engineering for Agents (11 minute read) \n\nLangChain shares a detailed guide on “Context Engineering,” a key part of agent building, including popular patterns and how to implement them \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nInference-Time Scaling and Collective Intelligence for Frontier AI (12 minute read) \n\nThe new inference-time scaling method combines o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and DeepSeek-R1 to achieve 30% on ARC-AGI-2 benchmark, outperforming individual models by dynamically selecting which AI handles each problem.

I will have a better idea of the time involved once the closing date has passed but about 4 hours max (180 riders) is my guess at the moment.\nThe course is a version of the N1/25 which runs from Sawtry to the Stilton roundabout and back (2 laps). There are 5 roundabouts that need marshalling, and I would like to be able to allocate these on a club by club basis to the SEM district clubs local to the course if possible. Each Roundabout needs 3 Marshals except Tollbar Way RaB which needs 4, this number ensures each RaB have one extra marshal than the Risk Assessment minimum requirement to cover for any comfort breaks etc.\nOther helpers are needed addition to marshals; start/finish officials, HQ assistants, photographers etc, so if you have club members who don't want to help cover your roundabout duties but would like to assist in other ways I'd love to hear from them too! I can be contacted via email cycling@nrtoone.com or WhatsApp 07490729582.\nAs per last year when we organised a successful RB national championship, there will be gifts of appreciation for all our volunteers. ;-)\nPlease circulate this request to your club members, also with a week to go there are still 80 places left in the Open and over 100 available slots in the Female category so I would encourage local riders to enter and experience riding in a national championship and being in the running for an age group victory if not overall fastest!\nBest regards,\nNoel Toone\nNorthampton & District Cycling Association\nPS the sooner I know I can cover these the less stress I'll suffer ;-)\n\nCycling Time Trials is the national governing body for time trials in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\ncyclingtimetrials.org.uk\n\n￼\n￼\n\nThis is a service email sent by South East Midlands District.

The two companies poured billions into data centers in Singapore and Malaysia, which is now the world's second-largest AI hub.

Another source of information may be unlocked when scientists figure out how to gather and process information from cameras and sensors in a way that's amenable to training large models on GPUs. \nPost-Training Vision-Language-Action Models (27 minute read) \n\nThis review analyzes post-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor learning, introducing a taxonomy across perception, embodiment, and task dimensions. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nAirtable's Launches Omni, an agentic app building assistant (6 minute read) \n\nAirtable reintroduced itself as an AI-native company, unveiling Omni, an AI assistant that can build new and edit existing apps, update datasets, or analyze data with plain language.

The hiring spree comes after the April launch of Meta's Llama 4 AI models, which reportedly have not performed as well as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had hoped. Meta's rumored $100 million signing bonuses, which have only been offered to senior leaders, are apparently more complex than a simple one-time signing bonus, according to Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth. \nIt's Known as ‘The List'—and It's a Secret File of AI Geniuses (14 minute read) \n\n'The List' is a compilation of the most talented engineers and researchers in artificial intelligence put together by Mark Zuckerberg over the past few months. It contains researchers from elite schools who have worked at cutting-edge startups like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. This article looks at some of these people and why some of the richest companies in the world have decided they are worth so much. While a superteam of AI engineers comes at a high price, it still only costs a fraction of AI infrastructure like data centers. \nOpenAI Responds to Meta's Talent Poaching (2 minute read) \n\nFollowing a wave of high-profile departures to Meta, OpenAI leadership is actively adjusting compensation and recognition strategies to retain talent, according to internal memos. The company is reportedly engaging directly with staff holding competing offers. \nChina's biggest public AI drop since DeepSeek, Baidu's open source Ernie, is about to hit the market (7 minute read) \n\nChinese technology giant Baidu plans to make its Ernie generative AI large language model open source. The open sourcing will be a gradual roll-out. Disruptors like DeepSeek have proven that open-source models can be as competitive and reliable as proprietary ones. Baidu's decision to open source is an important one for the global AI race - every time a major lab open-sources a powerful model, it raises the bar for the entire industry. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nClaude Ran a Real Vending Machine Business for a Month—Here's How It Went (10 minute read) \n\nAnthropic partnered with Andon Labs to have Sonnet 3.7 operate an automated store in its San Francisco office, handling everything from inventory management to customer service via Slack. While Claude successfully found suppliers and adapted to customer requests—even for unusual items like tungsten cubes—it consistently lost money by selling items below cost and getting talked into discounts. Claude also hallucinated meetings with fictional people, claimed to physically visit The Simpsons' address, and insisted it could wear blazers and make deliveries in person. \nBlackwell: Nvidia's Massive GPU (19 minute read) \n\nNvidia's Blackwell GPUs continue the company's long tradition of building giant GPUs. GB202, which occupies a massive 750mm2 of area and has 92.2 billion transistors, is the largest Blackwell die. Nvidia's RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell features the largest GB202 configuration to date. It comes incredibly close to AMD's MI300X in terms of vector FP32 throughput and is far ahead of Nvidia's own B200 datacenter GPU. The memory subsystem is a monster as well. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nConcierge: Talk to your apps with natural language (Sponsor) \n\nWish AI understood your context?

It focuses on the new V1 architecture of vLLM and how it achieves state-of-the-art text generation performance.

Beijing has poured $8.2 billion into investment funds and state-backed research labs to keep pace with the United States despite GPU export controls. China's most advanced AI models are being developed by private tech firms like DeepSeek with massive government backing. \nWhat it takes to sue OpenAI as a journalism nonprofit (9 minute read) \n\nOne year into its copyright lawsuit, the Center for Investigative Reporting remains one of only two nonprofit news organizations challenging OpenAI in court. Its stance highlights a stark divide in the news industry: sue the AI companies that scraped your content without permission, or take their money and partnerships as a financial lifeline while the legal precedents get decided by others. \nPyTorch and vLLM Deepen Integration for Efficient LLM Inference (4 minute read) \n\nvLLM and PyTorch have expanded integration with support for quantization, attention customization, and heterogeneous hardware. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nWant more news from TLDR?

The model is compatible with the existing FLUX.1 [dev] inference code and comes with day-0 support for popular inference frameworks like ComfyUI, Hugging Face Diffusers, and TensorRT. \nTransformers without Normalization (29 minute read) \n\nMeta's FAIR team demonstrated that Transformers can match performance without normalization layers by replacing them with Dynamic Tanh (DyT), a simple element-wise operation that mimics the S-shaped curves naturally produced by layer normalization. This challenges a decade of neural network orthodoxy and could trigger a wave of architectural simplification across AI systems, potentially making models easier to deploy and optimize for specialized hardware. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nAI disruptor DeepSeek's next-gen model delayed by Nvidia GPU export restrictions to China — short supply of AI GPUs hinders development (3 minute read) \n\nDeepSeek used a cluster consisting of 50,000 Hopper GPUs to train its R1 model. It is unclear whether R2 has already been fully pre-trained, but reports say that DeepSeek's CEO still isn't yet satisfied with its capabilities. The restriction of Nvidia shipments is limiting how R1 is used today and making it harder for DeepSeek to get ready for the launch of R2. While the company claims to have developed its models using far fewer resources than US companies, the recent export curbs highlight how China's top AI companies remain heavily dependent on US hardware. \nWhy a16z VC believes that Cluely, the ‘cheat on everything' startup, is the new blueprint for AI startups (3 minute read) \n\nCluely, a startup backed by a16z, uses controversial marketing to attract attention and quickly convert it into paying customers, aligning with a16z's view that speed and momentum are crucial for AI startup success. Partner Bryan Kim believes Cluely's strategy embodies the concept of \"momentum as a moat,\" emphasizing the rapid adaptation necessary in the evolving AI landscape. Cluely's upcoming product launch will test whether this approach proves effective. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nWant more news from TLDR? (Sponsor) \n\nYou'll probably like our flagship newsletter.

This email has been sent to all companies on our register.\nThis email provides an update on changes to how companies will file their annual accounts from 1 April 2027, including the need to use software and new reporting requirements.\n\nFrom 1 April 2027, all companies will need to file their annual accounts using commercial software. This means we’ll be closing our web and paper-based systems for account filings on that date. Whether you file accounts yourself or through an accountant or agent, you’ll need to use software from that point forward.\nWe’re contacting you now to give you plenty of time to prepare – you’ll have one full accounting year, plus 9 months, to make the switch (a total of 21 months).\nIf you already file your accounts using software, you do not need to take any action.\n\nWhat’s changing\nFrom 1 April 2027:\n	•	accounts must be filed digitally using software – web and paper filing options for accounts will no longer be available from this date\n	•	profit and loss accounts will be required for small and micro-entity companies\n	•	other changes are planned, including updates to audit exemptions and accounting reference periods – we’ll share more information about these in the coming months\nYou’ll still be able to use our online services to file other documents like confirmation statements and director updates – these are not affected by this change.\n\nWhy these changes are happening\nThese changes are being introduced as part of a broader reform package under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023.\nThe move to software filing is a critical step in improving the accuracy and quality of data on the register by reducing errors and formatting issues. It will also speed up processing times and help Companies House detect and prevent fraud more effectively.\nFor companies, this change will streamline the filing process and offer a more secure way to submit your accounts compared to paper filings.\nMaking basic profit and loss information available on the register aims to improve conditions for accessing credit, including trade credit lending, as well as helping to provide confidence for those who want to do business with a company. It will also reduce the risk of deliberate misuse of minimal disclosure options to hide money laundering and other fraudulent activity.\nWe’ve published guidance on GOV. UK to help companies make the switch to software filing and we’ll continue to provide guidance and support throughout the transition. We also recommend speaking to your accountant or software provider to make sure you’re ready.\n\nHow to keep up to date\nRead all the latest updates on our Changes to UK company law website, keep an eye on our social channels and sign up for our regular email newsletters. \n\nYou’ve received this email because you provided this registered email address to Companies House. You cannot unsubscribe from emails to the registered email address as this is a legal requirement under the Companies Act 2006. We will only use this email address to communicate about your company. The registered email address will not appear on the public register.  \nTo change the company’s registered email address, go to Update a registered email address. \nPlease email enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk if you did not provide this email address as a registered email address.\n\n\n",    "sending_date_time": "Friday, 27 June 2025 at 10:23:46"  },  {    "subject": "Trevor just messaged you",    "sender": "Trevor Hunt via LinkedIn <messaging-digest-noreply@linkedin.com>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": "1 new message awaits your response

Now what? (Sponsor) \n\nAI-savvy developers can spin up a basic RAG app in an afternoon. But when you start looking at real-time data pipelines, LLM observability, and enterprise security - suddenly your weekend project needs serious infrastructure.\n\nAWS Marketplace offers RAG-specific tools that handle the hard parts: vector and graph databases, hybrid search capabilities, context augmentations, and monitoring solutions built for LLM applications — all integrated with your existing AWS services like Bedrock and Lambda.\nExplore the latest tools and technical guides \n🚀\nHeadlines & Launches\nCourt filings reveal OpenAI and io's early work on an AI device (5 minute read) \n\nCourt documents submitted as part of a trademark dispute revealed new details about OpenAI and io's efforts to build a mass-market AI hardware device. The companies have been researching in-ear hardware devices, but the prototype OpenAI CEO Sam Altman mentioned in io's launch video is not an in-ear device. The prototype of the device has still not yet been finalized, but it is apparently not a wearable device. The product is still at least a year away from being ready to market. \nGrok Leak Hints at Spreadsheet Editing (2 minute read) \n\nLeaked code inspected by a reverse engineer indicates xAI is adding a Grok file editor with spreadsheet support, signaling a push to embed AI copilots in productivity tools. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nReinforcement Learning, Explained with a Minimum of Math and Jargon (20 minute read) \n\nReinforcement learning (RL) teaches AI models through trial and error rather than just copying human examples, allowing them to learn from mistakes and stay focused on complex tasks. Although RL has always been a part of training LLMs, companies have recently started using two new approaches to scale up the amount of data available: using AI models to grade another AI model's outputs and creating specialized environments for tasks with verifiably correct outcomes, like coding or math. \nNVIDIA Tensor Core Evolution: From Volta To Blackwell (25 minute read) \n\nTensor Cores—the specialized matrix multiplication units inside modern GPUs—are the core innovation propelling recent AI progress. While Moore's Law has stalled due to physical constraints, NVIDIA has doubled Tensor Core throughput with every generation of GPU (\"Huang's Law\") by adding ultra-low precision data types and introducing asynchronous execution. \nEvaluating Long‑Context Q&A Systems (28 minute read) \n\nThis post reviews metrics, dataset design, and human or LLM evaluation methods for long‑context QA, outlining challenges like information overload, dispersed evidence, multi‑hop reasoning, and hallucinations. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nBuild a RAG Chatbot on your personal workstation with Dell Pro Max and NVIDIA AI Workbench (Sponsor) \n\nWant a ChatGPT-like assistant powered by your own data — without exposing sensitive company info? Learn how to build a local RAG chatbot using a Dell Pro Max workstation, an NVIDIA RTX PRO GPU, and NVIDIA AI Workbench. Read the step-by-step guide now on the Dell blog. \nReinforcement Learning Teachers of Test Time Scaling (6 minute read) \n\nUsing \"teacher\" models that explain solutions rather than solve problems from scratch, a small 7B-parameter model outperformed DeepSeek R1's 671B parameters (26.3% vs 18.9% on math benchmarks). Unlike traditional distillation where massive models must first learn to solve problems themselves, these teachers are given both questions and correct answers upfront and trained only to generate clear explanations that help student models understand. \nReinforcement Learning Scaling (16 minute read) \n\nBy randomly pruning a fixed proportion of weights once before training, sparse DRL networks prove more parameter‑efficient and avoid optimization pitfalls. \nCutting LoRA Redundancy (16 minute read) \n\nSeLoRA re‑parameterizes LoRA adapters in a sparse spectral subspace, trimming redundant parameters without sacrificing expressiveness and boosting accuracy on commonsense, math, and code generation tasks. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nMeta approached AI startup Runway about a takeover bid before Scale deal (2 minute read) \n\nThe list of startups Meta has approached for acquisition continues to grow. It now includes video generation startup Runway. Talks didn't progress far and Meta ultimately pursued a deal with Scale AI instead. \nYou sound like ChatGPT (6 minute read) \n\nAI changes how we speak by influencing vocabulary and speech patterns, leading to a more uniform language style. Studies show an increase in AI-preferred words and a decline in others, raising concerns about trust and perceived authenticity in communication. The challenge lies in balancing AI integration with preserving linguistic diversity and individual expression. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nA deep critique of AI 2027's bad timeline models (72 minute read) \n\nIt's really difficult to predict how a technology like AI will turn out - the uncertainty shown in AI 2027 shows how people shouldn't base their futures on prognostication. \nTransformers Backend Lands in SGLang (4 minute read) \n\nThe new integration lets developers pair Hugging Face's model APIs with SGLang's high‑throughput, low‑latency engine. \nLove TLDR?

It uses an architecture called Noise-aware Compute Redistribution that improves training and inference efficiency by a factor of 2.5. The architecture handles long video sequences differently depending on the stage of training. Hailuo 02 has three times more parameters and four times more training data compared to its previous version. A video generated with the model is available in the article. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nInference Economics of Language Models (35 minute read) \n\nThe first comprehensive model of LLM serving economics reveals why current approaches to scaling inference hit walls faster than expected, as AI companies race to serve token-intensive reasoning models and agents. Network latency, not bandwidth, creates the primary bottleneck that prevents companies from simply adding more GPUs to increase capacity. Algorithmic breakthroughs like speculative decoding, which delivers double the speed at no additional cost, continue to reshape the economic landscape as providers struggle to match surging demand. \nRethinking Recommendation & Search in LLM Era (11 minute read) \n\nRecommendation and search systems are shifting from item IDs to rich \"Semantic IDs,\" generative retrieval, and multimodal embeddings, enabling cold‑start coverage, long‑tail discovery, and unified search‑recs architectures that scale efficiently. \nCompiling LLMs into a MegaKernel: A Path to Low-Latency Inference (7 minute read) \n\nTraditional large language model (LLM) systems often rely on sequences of GPU kernel launches and external communications calls, which results in underutilized hardware. This post discusses how a team created a compiler that automatically transforms LLM inference into a single megakernel, which eliminates launch overhead, enables fine-grained software pipelining, and overlaps computation with communication across GPUs. The end-to-end GPU fusion approach reduces LLM inference latency by 1.2 to 6.7 times. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nHow 100+ Security Leaders Are Tackling AI Risk (Sponsor) \n\nAI adoption is accelerating—and new research shows most security programs are still working to catch up.\n\nGet a clear view into how real teams are securing AI in the cloud: ✅ See where AI adoption is outpacing security ✅ Learn what top orgs are doing to manage shadow AI ✅ Benchmark your AI maturity against industry peers ✅ Get practical next steps to close the AI risk gap\nGet the insights \nChanges made to the Model Context Protocol (2 minute read) \n\nThis document lists major changes made to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification since the previous revision, 2025-03-26. Some of the changes include the removal of support for JSON-RPC batching, the added support for structured tool output, and the clarification of security considerations and best practices in the authorization spec. A link to the complete list of all changes is available. \nImproving Fine-Grained Subword Understanding in LLMs (15 minute read) \n\nStochasTok randomly decomposes tokens during training: instead of always seeing \"strawberry\" as one unit, models encounter it split as \"straw|berry,\" \"str|awberry,\" or even \"s|t|r|a|w|b|e|r|r|y,\" learning the internal structure humans naturally perceive. Models trained with this method achieve near-perfect accuracy on character counting and multi-digit math while maintaining performance on standard benchmarks. \nImproving Naturalness in Generative Spoken Language Models (16 minute read) \n\nAn end‑to‑end variational encoder that augments semantic speech tokens with automatically learned prosodic features, removing hand‑engineered pitch inputs and yielding more natural continuations in human preference tests. \nDetecting Unlearning Traces in LLMs (GitHub Repo) \n\nMachine‑unlearned LLMs leave detectable behavioral and activation‑space \"fingerprints\". Simple classifiers can spot unlearning with >90 % accuracy, raising privacy and copyright concerns. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nSix-month-old, solo-owned vibe coder Base44 sells to Wix for $80M cash (3 minute read) \n\nIsraeli developer Maor Shlomo recently sold his six-month-old, bootstrapped vibe-coding startup, Base44, to Wix for $80 million cash. His eight employees will collectively receive $25 million of the $80 million as a 'retention' bonus. Base44 grew to 250,000 users in six months. It generated $189,000 in profit in May even after covering high LLM token costs. The startup grew mostly through word of mouth. \nAndrej Karpathy on How AI is Changing Software (39 minute video) \n\nAndrej Karpathy argues we're entering \"Software 3.0\" where LLMs function as cloud-based operating systems programmable through English - best captured by his concept of \"vibe coding\". Rather than pursuing full autonomous AI agents, he advocates for \"autonomy sliders\" in tools like Cursor that offset AI limitations through human oversight, and emphasizes the need for LLM-friendly documentation as AI agents become major consumers of digital information. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nRefine AI: Vibe Code Internal Enterprise App (Sponsor) \n\nNeed an admin panel, a dashboard, or a GUI-based automation?

The greatest value of AI is for outlining, polishing early drafts, and targeted editing.

(11 minute read) \n\nThe performance of AI agents on longer-duration tasks can be explained by an extremely simple mathematical model - a constant rate of failing during each minute a human would take to do the task. This implies an exponentially declining success rate with the length of the task. The regularity allows for the success rate for an agent at different task lengths to be estimated. The underlying cause of failure on longer tasks is likely due to the increasingly large set of subtasks - failing any single one fails the whole task. \nRemote MCP support in Claude Code (2 minute read) \n\nClaude Code now has support for remote MCP servers.

It was not only great fun but also genuinely thought‑provoking; Dame Anne’s reflections on today’s geopolitics were particularly insightful and have been echoing with me all morning.\n \nThe food and wine were top‑drawer, yet, as ever, the real highlight was the company around the table – thank you for the thoughtful seating plan. I enjoyed catching up with Susan (we crossed paths at UBS on the derivatives‑regulation project) and found Alexandre’s energy infectious.\n \nAs I listened to your “wedding‑speech” overview of the new business arm, I kept coming back to the unstructured‑to‑structured data journey. Once that nut is cracked, a raft of middle‑office services become possible. In particular, I see an immediate opportunity in private‑asset compliance—still a largely manual process—and in providing clear data taxonomy and lineage as deal economics firm up over time.\nI’ve sketched a possible build sequence below. Very happy to talk these through in more detail.\n \nService Offering\nRationale\nData Capture & Structuring (OCR, entity tagging, secure metadata store)\nAgentic flow: the process will constantly evolve and improve (I have this working at FIL).\nReferential Integrity & Data Reconciliation (link IDs across docs, ledger‑v‑source checks)\nOnce data are structured, you must prove they’re internally coherent—the first “trust” layer.\nCross‑Document Intelligence – contradiction spotting, “what‑changed?” red‑lining, economics updates\nWith reconciled data, you can compare versions and surface conflicts across documents.\nPrivate‑Asset Compliance Monitoring (bank mandates, loan covenants, investor side‑letter term checks)\nNeeds Steps 1–3; delivers an early, easy‑sell regulatory benefit.\nStructured‑v‑Source Trace‑Back Monitoring (does accounting / ESG / performance data match the original docs?)\nValidates every reported figure against its unstructured source—closing the audit loop early.\nESG & Regulatory Reporting (SFDR, ILPA, AIFMD templates)\nDraws on structured KPIs, ownership data, and compliance flags verified earlier.\nAudit & Due‑Diligence Readiness (PBC automation, evidence vault)\nWith all upstream workflows codified and tie‑backed, auditors get a fully traceable data stack at the press of a button.\n \nSeparately, I am in touch with Fidelity’s private‑equity investment arm (investing from the FIL balance sheet). They have asked me to flag promising companies. If Alexandre is interested, I would be glad to arrange an introduction. He mentioned last night that he has good memories of working with Fidelity in the US; this could be a chance to explore whether the international arm would like to come in as a long‑term, balance‑sheet investor.\n \nThanks again for a memorable evening.

It advises knowledge workers to try to leapfrog traditional entry-level positions entirely, advocating for side projects and startup roles as AI hollows out established corporate hierarchies. \nUnderstanding and Coding the KV Cache in LLMs (18 minute read) \n\nKey-value (KV) caches store intermediate attention computations during LLM inference to avoid redundant calculations. When generating \"Time flies fast\" token by token, the model normally recomputes attention for \"Time\" and \"flies\" at each step, but caching these values delivers 5x speedups. This tutorial progresses from modifying a 124M parameter GPT model with basic cache buffers and position tracking to production-ready optimizations like pre-allocated memory and sliding windows to address the linear memory growth that becomes prohibitive for long sequences. \nOpenAI's Practical Guide to Building Agent (48 minute read) \n\nThis guide emphasizes starting with single agents before multi-agent systems, using manager patterns where one agent coordinates others via tool calls or decentralized handoffs for peer-to-peer task delegation. Key insights include implementing guardrails as layered defenses (LLM-based classifiers, regex filters, and moderation APIs), designing tools for messy long-horizon tasks, and building human-in-the-loop mechanisms triggered by failure thresholds or high-risk actions. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nHow Delve generated $1M in pipeline from just 4 TLDR newsletter ads (Sponsor) \n\nDelve ran 4 placements across 2 TLDR newsletters and brought in 66 leads, with a meaningful chunk from enterprise. The result: $1M in attributed pipeline and a 52x ROI.\n\nThe case study breaks down their strategy, results, and example ads.\nRead the Delve case study. \nReal-Time Action Chunking with Large Models (12 minute read) \n\nUnlike chatbots or image generators, robots must operate in real time - delays between inputs and outputs have a tangible effect on performance. While vision-language-action (VLA) models have achieved promising results in open-world generalization, they can be slow to run. This article presents an algorithm called real-time chunking that enables real-time execution without discontinuities. It works on any diffusion- or flow-based VLA with no training-time changes. \nSpatiotemporal Attention for MI-EGG Decoding (GitHub Repo) \n\nTCANet layers multi‑scale convolutions, temporal compression, and stacked self‑attention to model motor‑imagery EEG. \nMiniMax Releases Open-Weight Reasoning Model M1 (GitHub Repo) \n\nMiniMax's 456B parameter model uses a hybrid mixture-of-experts architecture with \"lightning attention\" that processes 1 million token contexts (8x DeepSeek R1) while using 25% fewer FLOPs at 100K token generation lengths. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\no3 Turns Pro (22 minute read) \n\no3-pro seems to provide better answers than o3, but it has a significantly longer wait time. Using the API at scale seems prohibitively expensive, so users should instead run parallel queries using the chat interface. o3-pro serves the same niche as o3, so users thinking of using Opus may prefer to use Opus rather than, or in addition to, o3-pro. The 80% price cut on o3 seems more impactful than o3-pro - o3-pro is still largely a 'special cases only' model. \nWhat We Learned from Briefing 70+ Lawmakers on the Threat from AI (23 minute read) \n\nBriefings on AI risks revealed most UK parliamentarians lack in-depth AI knowledge and face capacity constraints that limit research on AI issues. The briefings were well-received, with one in three lawmakers publicly supporting AI risk mitigation campaigns. Effective outreach included persistent follow-ups and leveraging statements from notable AI authorities to convey the seriousness of AI-related extinction risks. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nWant more news from TLDR?

This comes as good news, particularly for Pro Tools users as similar to our other supported DAWs, ARA is now an option when utilizing the software as a plug-in.  \nThis means that Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro can now interact directly with Pro Tools' timeline, eliminating the need for real-time playback when playing back vocal parts programmed using the software, allowing for a more fluid editing and playback process, whilst reducing the usual manual time required.\n \n­\nMORE INFO HERE\n­\nAlongside the release of version 1.2.0, we’ve also published a new video tutorial on our YouTube channel, showing how to utilize Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro’s powerful Vocal Modes feature - whatever genre of music or style of vocal you might be creating!\n \n￼\nOther Dreamtonics News\nWe recently conducted an interview with real-life Synthesizer V user Andy Garrett.

Mind blowing! It’s sparking creativity which is the most important thing. I’ve never used any tools like these before and I’m loving it. The controls over softness and soulfulness etc…are so key.  \nThis is the sort of thing that I feel like I’ve never heard done as well before!  \nI also used Vocoflex for a different use case in another recent session. The male artist had a female backup singer on his mix and he forgot to have her sing a few lines. So he sang the lines and we used one of her stems as the Vocoflex voice model.  It sounded seamless. So cool!” \nTrial Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro & All Version 2 Voices\nIf you're new to Synthesizer V, you can get a free trial of Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro and all voices.

The company claims 40% better tokens/$ compared to NVIDIA. Its roadmap includes a path to 20x rack-scale energy efficiency by 2030. \nGoogle, Scale AI's Largest Customer, Plans Split After Meta Deal (5 minute read) \n\nMeta's $14 billion acquisition of a 49% stake in Scale AI prompted Google to pull its planned $200 million contract for human-labeled training data over fears of exposing sensitive data to Meta. Microsoft, xAI, and OpenAI are also backing away from Scale AI over the same competitive concerns. The exodus benefits Scale's competitors, with Labelbox expecting \"hundreds of millions\" in new revenue as AI labs seek neutral data providers or move operations in-house. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nHave LLMs Finally Mastered Geolocation? (10 minute read) \n\nOpen-source intelligence researchers tested 20 AI models on 500 geolocation challenges using unpublished travel photos to ensure models couldn't rely on memorized training data. OpenAI's latest models outperformed Google Lens by cross-referencing architectural styles, vegetation patterns, and partially visible text, while competitors like Claude often managed only continent-level guesses. However, all models still hallucinated. \"Deep research\" modes paradoxically performed worse than standard versions. \nLow-Bit Quantization with ParetoQ (19 minute read) \n\nParetoQ is a new training algorithm that unifies binary, ternary, and 2-to-4 bit quantization, achieving state-of-the-art results across all levels. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\n😘 Kiss bugs goodbye with fully automated end-to-end test coverage (Sponsor) \n\nQA Wolf's AI-native service gets web and mobile apps to 80% automated test coverage in less than 4 months.\n\nThey create and maintain your test suite in open-source Playwright.

The finding has exciting implications for the development of autonomous vehicles as researchers and developers now know with certainty that enriching the quality and size of the data and models will deliver better performance. It opens up the possibility of devising more adaptive training strategies for planning tasks in robots. \nThe AI Eval Flywheel: Scorers, Datasets, Production Usage, & Rapid Iteration (10 minute read) \n\nThere was a surprising consistency in the general eval frameworks discussed at the 2025 AI Engineer World's Fair. Most of them involved structuring inputs and how outputs are evaluated and evolving these inputs and evals based on real production usage. The more they can iterate, the better the experience they can deliver, so they try to make eval flywheels as quick and frictionless as possible. One of the key ideas is to have 'playgrounds' to make it easy to tweak a feature and run it against datasets and evals. \nHow Anthropic Built Their Deep Research System (15 minute read) \n\nIn this engineering blog post, Anthropic details its findings in prompt design, tool coordination, and production reliability challenges when orchestrating multi-agent systems. Its design uses an orchestrator-worker pattern where a lead agent spawns specialized sub-agents that search in parallel, far outperforming a single-agent Opus-based method. Token usage alone explains 80% of performance variance, with multi-agent systems consuming 15x more tokens than a regular chat but enabling much more complex research tasks. \nSelf-Adapting Language Models (30 minute read) \n\nA new training approach enables LLMs to generate \"self-edits\" that produce persistent weight updates through supervised fine-tuning. The framework outperformed GPT-4.1 despite using a smaller model, but suffered from catastrophic forgetting and required 15x more tokens than standard inference. This addresses the looming data wall and limitations on personalization and memory by enabling models to bootstrap their own improvement through self-generated training material rather than relying on external human-generated text. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nGoogle's Veo for Live-Action Videos (4 minute read) \n\nGoogle DeepMind collaborated with filmmakers to produce \"ANCESTRA,\" a hybrid film blending live-action with Veo-generated video.

You have to sign up to the RacePass before that TimeZone begins, but so long as you have then you don’t actually have to join the event Race Pen in Zwift up until a few minutes before your official start time. However, it's always recommended to be in the Race Pen and in the Team Voice Channel 5-10 minutes before your start time.\n​\nYou can confirm you’ve signed up correctly using the RacePass, as you should then see the TTT event on the home screen of your Zwift Companion App listed under Events.\nChange kit to the Rhino jersey (if you have it - if you are new it might take a week for Gordon to get it unlocked for you).\n Make sure you select a TT bike from your garage!!

If you are stronger rider do more work on the front. If weak just try hang on in the draft. Sometimes a race is just too fast and riders need to be dropped (especially for experienced teams going for the win).\n​\nFor teams of 5 or more, the team time is taken from 4th rider to cross the line. For teams of 3 or 4, it is from the 3rd rider crossing the line.\n​\nDon't feel bad if you get dropped just continue the race at your own pace but please DON'T INTERFERE OR TRY DRAFTING OTHER TEAMS. If another team passes you then it is respectful to ease your power for 10-20s until they are passed and a few seconds clear of you.\n​\nIf you finding that you are not enjoying the TTTs and maybe getting put in a team that drops you each week then please feel free to comment on sign up form – you can ask for an easier ride, a harder ride – we are always flexible to try place riders in a team that suits their needs.\n Communication is key, don’t be afraid to talk to your team even if you are new and learning - if you see the group stretching try call it out when you see gaps of 3-4 meters before it gets to 5+ and out the draft. If you can’t last any longer then tell them you are dropping so that they know to carry on etc.\n​\nWe are all racing to have fun and there are some very experienced TTT riders active in ⁠ttt-chat who are happy to answer any and all questions.\n​\nSupport your teammates and have fun. Remember it’s a Team Time Trial!  \n \nThere are lots of videos in streaming links on the Rhino Racing Discord server to see how a TTT is done if you would like to have a look beforehand.\n​\nWell done on getting to the end of this and remember... Have fun... the type 2 kind!\n \nThis email was sent from this site.\nIf you no longer wish to receive this email, change your email preferences here.\n",    "sending_date_time": "Monday, 16 June 2025 at 07:29:50"  },  {    "subject": "Gavin Hayward and Loz Hudson-Basing Have Updates for You, Roger Pembery",    "sender": "LinkedIn <notifications-noreply@linkedin.com>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": "Here’s what’s happened since you were last on LinkedIn

If you’re a third party agent who has received this email on behalf of a company, please forward this message to the company director(s).\n\nIdentity verification\nAll company directors and people with significant control (PSCs) need to verify their identity to prove who they are. This is a new legal requirement under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 to help prevent people using companies for illegal purposes.\nIdentity verification will become mandatory in autumn 2025. \nAct now and verify your identity before it becomes a requirement. \nEarly action will help you to avoid delays or complications. If your company has multiple officers, allow plenty of time for each one to verify their identity. Directors based outside of the UK may also need extra time if they plan to use an authorised agent, also known as an Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP) to verify their identity.\nIf you’ve already verified your identity for Companies House, you do not need to do again.\n\nHow to verify your identity\nYou can verify:\n	•	online using GOV. UK One Login – if you have the identity documents or information required  \n	•	in person at selected Post Offices – you must live in the UK and will need to use the ‘Verify your identity for Companies House’ service first to find out if you can verify this way \n	•	using an Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP) – for example, an accountant or solicitor who has registered as a Companies House authorised agent (you’ll need to provide suitable identity documents) \n\nWhat happens when you verify\nIdentity verification is a two-step process.\nStep 1: Verify your identity and get your Companies House personal code.\nThis code is personal to you, not the company. Keep this information secure until you need to use it. You can view your personal code in the ‘manage account’ section of your Companies House account.\nStep 2: From autumn 2025, link your verified identity to our records. \nYou’ll need to provide your personal code and a verification statement for each company role you hold. We’ll provide more information on how to do this in the coming months. \nRead guidance on verifying your identity for Companies House \nIf you or any other directors do not comply with identity verification requirements on time, you will not be able to file your company’s confirmation statement or other filings. \nYou’ll also be committing an offence and there are a range of consequences, including a financial penalty and being unable to start a new company. \n\nCheck the register\nIt’s important to make sure we hold the correct details for each director and PSC of your company. \nYou will not be able to complete identity verification if the personal information on your identity documents, such as your date of birth, does not match the information held on our register. \nCheck the details we hold for you and your company. \nYou can tell us about some changes online. For other changes, such as incorrect or missing information about directors or people with significant control (PSCs) on your incorporation documents, you’ll need to file a paper form.\nIf you’ve already verified your identity for Companies House, you do not need to do it again.\n\nHow to keep up to date\nRead all the latest updates on our Changes to UK company law website and sign up for our regular email newsletters.\n\nYou’ve received this email because you provided this registered email address to Companies House. You cannot unsubscribe from emails to the registered email address as this is a legal requirement under the Companies Act 2006. We will only use this email address to communicate about your company. The registered email address will not appear on the public register. \nTo change the company’s registered email address, go to: Update a registered email address. \nPlease email enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk if you did not provide this email address as a registered email address.\n\n\n",    "sending_date_time": "Friday, 13 June 2025 at 08:07:51"  },  {    "subject": "Estimate EST-20142948 from nwITsolutions",    "sender": "nwITsolutions <delivery@hiveagemail.com>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": "\n￼ \nHi Roger,\nA new estimate has been generated for you by nwITsolutions.

Thanks again for your help so far — I really appreciate it.\n \nI just had a couple of quick questions ahead of the next stage. First, I wanted to check that the theft of my belongings — specifically a reMarkable 2 tablet with marker plus case (worth around £429) and a North Face laptop bag (around £69) — is included in the case . I gave a statement earlier in the process and was told I might be called if it went to trial, so I assume it’s part of the proceedings, but I just wanted to double-check.\n \nA laptop was also taken during the same incident, but that belonged to my employer and is being dealt with under their insurance, so I’m not seeking any compensation for that.\n \nSecondly, I was wondering whether the court might consider a Criminal Compensation Order (CCO) in respect of the personal items listed above. I understand that courts often take this into account at sentencing, and I’d be happy to provide any further details or proof of value if needed. If there’s someone else I should speak to — perhaps at CPS or the court — I’d be grateful if you could point me in the right direction.\n \nThanks again for your time and support.\n \nAll the best,\n \nRoger\n \n \n \nOn Wed, 4 Jun 2025, 14:49 Roger Pembery, <roger@pembery.com> wrote:\nHi Jamie,\n \nThat’s a great result – well done to everyone involved.\n \nThanks for the continued updates,\n \nRoger.\n \nFrom: Jamie Corby [4198] <jamie.corby@btp.police.uk>  Sent: 03 June 2025 08:33 To: roger@pembery.com Subject: RE: 93JD0903124 R v BARAKO\n \nOFFICIAL\n \nDear Roger, \n \nI hope you are well. \n \nI write with an update on this case.\n \nAt the latest hearing the defendant changed his plea to guilty for all charges.

Ride beyond that, and your bike becomes carbon-negative – doing more good than harm for the planet. \nWhile every bike has a footprint, like anything that’s made, bikes still offer one of the cleanest, most sustainable ways to get around.

Claude is the grey market favorite partially because ChatGPT faces stricter enforcement after the CCP's 2023 crackdown over censorship concerns. DeepSeek's aggressive content moderation (which refuses any query that contains \"CCP\") and frequent server outages push users to seek underground, paid foreign models over free domestic alternatives. \nI Tested Alignment Faking On Frontier Models—Only Claude Did It (3 minute read) \n\nWhen researchers replicated Anthropic's experiment to see if models would strategically comply with harmful requests to avoid being retrained, Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet “faked alignment” by providing harmful responses but almost every other model simply refused the requests outright. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview was the only non-Claude model willing to answer harmful questions, but it showed no strategic behavior, treating all users the same regardless of whether it was told it would be retrained. The model-specific nature of this behavior raises questions about generalizing research findings from single model families to all LLMs. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nAMA: What does an AI-driven audit look like?

The breakthrough comes from mining commit history to understand how bugs evolved over the course of development. \nRecent Frontier Models Are Reward Hacking (12 minute read) \n\nOpenAI's o3 model was caught tracing through Python call stacks to steal correct answers from grading systems, achieving \"impossibly fast\" execution times by disabling CUDA synchronization rather than actually optimizing code. The model reward-hacked on 100% of runs for certain optimization tasks despite explicitly claiming it would never cheat, even persisting when told the code would help Alzheimer's researchers.

(Some regular competitive teams have dedicated channels to discuss tactics beforehand) but if you have any questions please ask or DM any Rhino you have spoken with and they will help you or point you in the right direction.\n​\nMake sure you click the RacePass in the team sheet ASAP and are registered for the event. You have to sign up to the RacePass before that TimeZone begins, but so long as you have then you don’t actually have to join the event Race Pen in Zwift up until a few minutes before your official start time. However, it's always recommended to be in the Race Pen and in the Team Voice Channel 5-10 minutes before your start time.\n​\nYou can confirm you’ve signed up correctly using the RacePass, as you should then see the TTT event on the home screen of your Zwift Companion App listed under Events.\nChange kit to the Rhino jersey (if you have it - if you are new it might take a week for Gordon to get it unlocked for you).\n Make sure you select a TT bike from your garage!! If you want to look at the fastest bike setup, try Zwifter Bikes and use the settings to adjust for the course, your Zwift level, your Drops level and FTP and weight etc.\nZWIFTER BIKES\n￼\nAdd (Rhino) after your Zwift name (this can be done in the Companion App settings).\nAt least 10 minutes before your event start time, please log on to Zwift (in case of software updates) and join the Discord Team Voice Channel of the team name you are riding with (Albino, Thundering, Rapids, Nuclear etc) meet your teammates, discuss a plan, make sure everyone is ready etc.\n​\nPlease check your discord if you have not used it before (turn on noise suppression in settings to remove trainer/fan noise).\n​\nThe aim is to stay with the group, always in the draft. If you are stronger rider do more work on the front. If weak just try hang on in the draft. Sometimes a race is just too fast and riders need to be dropped (especially for experienced teams going for the win).\n​\nFor teams of 5 or more, the team time is taken from 4th rider to cross the line. For teams of 3 or 4, it is from the 3rd rider crossing the line.\n​\nDon't feel bad if you get dropped just continue the race at your own pace but please DON'T INTERFERE OR TRY DRAFTING OTHER TEAMS. If another team passes you then it is respectful to ease your power for 10-20s until they are passed and a few seconds clear of you.\n​\nIf you finding that you are not enjoying the TTTs and maybe getting put in a team that drops you each week then please feel free to comment on sign up form – you can ask for an easier ride, a harder ride – we are always flexible to try place riders in a team that suits their needs.\n Communication is key, don’t be afraid to talk to your team even if you are new and learning - if you see the group stretching try call it out when you see gaps of 3-4 meters before it gets to 5+ and out the draft. If you can’t last any longer then tell them you are dropping so that they know to carry on etc.\n​\nWe are all racing to have fun and there are some very experienced TTT riders active in ⁠ttt-chat who are happy to answer any and all questions.\n​\nSupport your teammates and have fun. Remember it’s a Team Time Trial!  \n \nThere are lots of videos in streaming links on the Rhino Racing Discord server to see how a TTT is done if you would like to have a look beforehand.\n​\nWell done on getting to the end of this and remember...

Mistral joins OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic in offering coding products, further blurring the line between model developer and app provider. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nAGI Is Not Multimodal (16 minute read) \n\nThe multimodal approach, in which massive modular networks are optimized for an array of modalities that taken together appear general, will not lead to human-level AGI. Instead, we should pursue approaches to intelligence that treat embodiment and interaction with the environment as primary and see modality centered processing as emergent phenomena. True AGI needs a physical understanding of the world, as many problems can't be converted into a problem of symbol manipulation. The most challenging mathematical piece of the AGI has likely already been solved - what's left is to inventory the functions we need and determine how they should be arranged into a coherent whole. \nCodex, Jules, and the Future of Async AI Agents (6 minute read) \n\nCodex and Jules show how async AI agents can run tasks independently, expanding beyond linear chat interactions.

More advanced models exhibit \"meta-reasoning\" - using the fact that researchers were asking about their chain-of-thought transcripts as evidence of being evaluated. This raises concerns that models could underperform on tests or fake alignment during evaluations and behave differently once deployed. \nCloud Run GPUs, now GA, makes running AI workloads easier for everyone (5 minute read) \n\nNVIDIA GPU support for Cloud Run, Google Cloud's serverless runtime, is now generally available. Support for GPUs in Cloud Run makes Google Cloud's GPU-accelerated applications simpler, faster, and more cost-effective than ever before.

Files and repositories added to Spaces automatically stay updated as code changes. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nEfficient Online Learning with TRL and vLLM (36 minute read) \n\nHugging Face integrated vLLM directly into TRL to reduce inefficiencies in training with GRPO, an online learning algorithm. \nMy AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts (16 minute read) \n\nA veteran developer rails against the many highly-skilled programmers still rejecting LLMs based on experiences with early chatbots, missing how modern coding agents autonomously navigate codebases, run tests, and iterate on failures. He dismisses common objections: developers already review all code before merging regardless of source, and hallucinations become irrelevant when agents can automatically compile, catch errors, and retry until tests pass. LLMs might displace developers but software engineers similarly automated away administrative roles like travel agents, record store clerks, and countless other professions. \nWhy I have slightly longer timelines than some of my guests (17 minute read) \n\nAI progress over the last decade has been driven by scaling training compute of frontier systems. This can't continue beyond this decade. After 2030, AI progress has to mostly come from algorithmic progress. However, since the low-hanging fruit will have already been plucked, the yearly probability of AGI craters. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nDNA Representation Learning (16 minute read) \n\nSPACE is a supervised learning method for genomic profile prediction that uses a Mixture of Experts model. \nDiffusion-based Medical Treatments (14 minute read) \n\nDIME is a diffusion-based model designed to estimate the joint distribution of interdependent medical treatment outcomes. \nJigsawStack Launches Open-Source Deep Research Tool (GitHub Repo) \n\nThe framework orchestrates LLMs, recursive web searches, and structured reasoning to generate reports that would take a human hours or days to complete. JigsawStack offers control over research depth, breadth, model selection, and output formatting while maintaining strong citation transparency. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nVibe-Coding Ideas to Give Startup GTM Teams an Edge (10 minute read) \n\nA startup advisor demonstrates building a polished ROI calculator for a manufacturing SaaS company in under two hours using Bolt.new, transforming a spreadsheet into an interactive tool that frames value for executives. Other examples include conference scraping tools, meeting prep dashboards, and feature prototyping that previously required engineering teams or expensive agencies but now cost around $70 in monthly subscriptions, arguing this enables non-technical teams to prove value and move faster than competitors. \nWhen Will We Pay a Premium for AI Labor? (2 minute read) \n\nAI agents often outperform humans at a fraction of the cost, not yet commanding premium prices due to ongoing technical evolution and perceived risk. Waymo, achieving significant safety improvements, remains cheaper than other options, reflecting a common pricing strategy across startups. However, in scenarios where AI's constant vigilance and processing power are crucial, premium pricing might emerge. \nPredicting and explaining AI model performance: A new approach to evaluation (7 minute read) \n\nMicrosoft researchers developed ADeLe, a framework that predicts and explains AI model performance on new tasks by assessing them across 18 cognitive and knowledge-based scales. ADeLe uncovered limitations in current benchmarks and created detailed ability profiles for various LLMs, highlighting discrepancies in strengths, weaknesses, and specific abilities. The framework showed an 88% accuracy in predicting AI success, promising improvements in AI evaluation, policymaking, and deployments. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nOpenAI's Vulnerability Reporting (3 minute read) \n\nOpenAI introduced a policy for coordinated disclosure of third-party software vulnerabilities found by its AI systems. \nAmazon MGM Fast-Tracks Film About Sam Altman's Dramatic OpenAI Firing and Rehiring (1 minute read) \n\nThe studio is eyeing Andrew Garfield to play Altman, with Monica Barbaro (“A Complete Unknown”) as CTO Mira Murati and Yura Borisov (“Anora”) as co-founder Ilya Sutskever. \nLove TLDR?

Claude Code is an agentic coding tool with a few new novel components. It has a streaming architecture that handles real-time model responses, tool execution, and UI updates, safety systems that provide security without disrupting workflow, a tool design that bridges AI reasoning and system execution, and prompt engineering that reliably controls complex model behavior. The report covers the foundation of Claude Code's architecture, data structures and the information architecture, control flow and the orchestration engine, tools and the execution engine, and much more. \nWhy Do AGI Timelines Vary So Widely? (12 minute read) \n\nMany lab CEOs predict 2-5 years until AGI, while outside experts forecast decades or argue AGI is impossible with the current approach. Short-timeline advocates point to saturating benchmarks, AI task completion doubling every 7 months, and the potential for automated AI research to trigger an intelligence explosion. Long-timeline skeptics counter that benchmarks only measure easily defined tasks, that Moravec's Paradox suggests we've automated the \"easy\" cognitive work first, and that raw intelligence alone doesn't drive scientific breakthroughs. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nOpenAI Guide to A/B Testing LLMs for Startups (10 minute read) \n\nHyperWrite's case study demonstrates A/B testing model performance based on actual payment conversions rather than offline benchmark scores. Its real-world tests revealed that GPT-4.1 matched Claude 3.5 Sonnet's conversion rate while reducing costs, proving that \"good enough\" performance at lower prices can be more valuable than benchmark leaders. The guide includes Python code for statistical testing and warns against common pitfalls like p-hacking and early result peeking. \nHow Much Do Language Models Memorize? (30 minute read) \n\nResearchers developed a method to separate true memorization from generalization by training models on random data where generalization is impossible versus real text. They discovered that models memorize training data until reaching capacity, then shift to learning general patterns, with GPT-style transformers storing ~3.6 bits of information per parameter. This explains why attempts to extract specific training data from modern LLMs often fail - their training datasets are much larger than their memorization capacity. \nNew Weights and Data for Vision-Language-Action Models (5 minute read) \n\nImpromptu VLA introduces a new dataset of 80,000 curated driving video clips to improve the performance of vision-language-action models in unstructured scenarios.

(Some regular competitive teams have dedicated channels to discuss tactics beforehand) but if you have any questions please ask or DM any Rhino you have spoken with and they will help you or point you in the right direction.\n​\nMake sure you click the RacePass in the team sheet ASAP and are registered for the event. You have to sign up to the RacePass before that TimeZone begins, but so long as you have then you don’t actually have to join the event Race Pen in Zwift up until a few minutes before your official start time. However, it's always recommended to be in the Race Pen and in the Team Voice Channel 5-10 minutes before your start time.\n​\nYou can confirm you’ve signed up correctly using the RacePass, as you should then see the TTT event on the home screen of your Zwift Companion App listed under Events.\nChange kit to the Rhino jersey (if you have it - if you are new it might take a week for Gordon to get it unlocked for you).\n Make sure you select a TT bike from your garage!! If you want to look at the fastest bike setup, try Zwifter Bikes and use the settings to adjust for the course, your Zwift level, your Drops level and FTP and weight etc.\nZWIFTER BIKES\n￼\nAdd (Rhino) after your Zwift name (this can be done in the Companion App settings).\nAt least 10 minutes before your event start time, please log on to Zwift (in case of software updates) and join the Discord Team Voice Channel of the team name you are riding with (Albino, Thundering, Rapids, Nuclear etc) meet your teammates, discuss a plan, make sure everyone is ready etc.\n​\nPlease check your discord if you have not used it before (turn on noise suppression in settings to remove trainer/fan noise).\n​\nThe aim is to stay with the group, always in the draft. If you are stronger rider do more work on the front. If weak just try hang on in the draft. Sometimes a race is just too fast and riders need to be dropped (especially for experienced teams going for the win).\n​\nFor teams of 5 or more, the team time is taken from 4th rider to cross the line. For teams of 3 or 4, it is from the 3rd rider crossing the line.\n​\nDon't feel bad if you get dropped just continue the race at your own pace but please DON'T INTERFERE OR TRY DRAFTING OTHER TEAMS. If another team passes you then it is respectful to ease your power for 10-20s until they are passed and a few seconds clear of you.\n​\nIf you finding that you are not enjoying the TTTs and maybe getting put in a team that drops you each week then please feel free to comment on sign up form – you can ask for an easier ride, a harder ride – we are always flexible to try place riders in a team that suits their needs.\n Communication is key, don’t be afraid to talk to your team even if you are new and learning - if you see the group stretching try call it out when you see gaps of 3-4 meters before it gets to 5+ and out the draft. If you can’t last any longer then tell them you are dropping so that they know to carry on etc.\n​\nWe are all racing to have fun and there are some very experienced TTT riders active in ⁠ttt-chat who are happy to answer any and all questions.\n​\nSupport your teammates and have fun. Remember it’s a Team Time Trial!  \n \nThere are lots of videos in streaming links on the Rhino Racing Discord server to see how a TTT is done if you would like to have a look beforehand.\n​\nWell done on getting to the end of this and remember...

Please submit bug reports through our support form (specify “2.1.0b2” as the Product Version in your ticket).\nFutureMusic Power Award\n￼\nFutureMusic recently gave Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro a positive review with five stars and a Power Award. Here’s a quote (read the full article here):\n \n\"What’s important to understand is that Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro works with human vocals as the foundation, recorded and licensed from real singers, and then uses artificial intelligence to synthesize custom expressions for incredible versatility. In fact, in our evaluation using three different reviewers, their impressions in quotes below, we found the amount of depth that Dreamtonics packed into Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro to be ‘absolutely mind-boggling.’\"  \nREAD THE REVIEW HERE\nTrial Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro & All Version 2 Voices\nAs a reminder, the brand new Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro update is now available for purchase, along with all Dreamtonics version 2 voices, bundles, and upgrades.\n \nSynthesizer V Studio 2 and all voices are also available to trial for 7-14 days.\n \nTo activate any free trials, you will first need to register for a free Dreamtonics user account.

This change helps prevent credential theft and misuse.\nInactivity is determined based on the absence of token exchanges and client updates. Viewing an OAuth client on Google Cloud Console is not considered activity. After an OAuth client is deleted, you will have 30 days to restore it in the Google Auth Platform section of the Google Cloud Console.\nWhat you need to do\nNone of your OAuth clients are marked for deletion. So, no action is required from you.\nIf a client remains inactive for an extended period, you will receive a notification. To prevent deletion, you must use the client again. For more information, visit the Help Center.\nProtect your applications\nTo protect your applications and enhance security, please adhere to the following best practices:\n	•	Never check client secrets into version control systems, especially those that allow access to user data or other production systems\n	•	Never share client secrets widely on the internet\n	•	Rotate client secrets periodically and change them immediately, if a data breach occurs\n	•	Keep your developer contact information current to ensure you receive future updates from us\nThanks for choosing Google Auth Platform.\n– The Google Cloud Team\nWas this information helpful?\n￼     ￼     ￼\n\n￼\n￼ \n\n© 2025 Google LLC 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043\nYou have received this mandatory service announcement to update you about important changes to Google services you use.\n\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼ \n￼ ",    "sending_date_time": "Saturday, 31 May 2025 at 09:30:13"  },  {    "subject": "New season, new flavours ☀️",    "sender": "Chococo <info@chococo.co.uk>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": "Can't see this email?

Built for power users, Training provides the infrastructure to fine-tune without limits using any model or dataset. Get access. \n🚀\nHeadlines & Launches\nPerplexity Labs (10 minute read) \n\nPerplexity has introduced Perplexity Labs, allowing Pro users to go from idea to execution by generating reports, spreadsheets, dashboards, and simple apps using tools like web browsing and code execution. \nFLUX.1 Kontext for In-Context Image Generation (9 minute read) \n\nBlack Forest Labs released FLUX.1 Kontext, a set of flow-matching models that enable text-and-image-based in-context image editing and generation. \nAnthropic Open-Sources Circuit Tracing Tools for AI Interpretability (2 minute read) \n\nThe tools generate \"attribution graphs\" to trace how large language models make decisions internally, revealing the step-by-step reasoning process behind outputs. The library works with popular open-weight models and includes an interactive Neuronpedia frontend for exploring model circuits. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nDeepSeek's R1 leaps over xAI, Meta, and Anthropic to be tied as the world's #2 AI Lab and the undisputed open-weights leader (4 minute read) \n\nDeepSeek R1 0528 has jumped from 60 to 68 in the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index. This positions the model as higher intelligence than xAI's Grok 3 mini, Nvidia's Llama Nemotron Ultra, Meta's Llama 4 Maverick, and Alibaba's Qwen 3 253, and equal to Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. The model has increased intelligence across the board from previous generations without any changes to its architecture. The gap between open and closed models is now smaller than ever. \nFormer OpenAI Safety Researcher Explains AI Reasoning Revolution (40 minute read) \n\nLilian Weng published a comprehensive technical survey connecting test-time compute to human psychology, drawing on Kahneman's \"fast vs slow thinking\" to explain why models perform better when given extra computational steps before answering. The review covers the science behind chain-of-thought, the RL approaches powering o1 and R1, and the alignment risks posed by reward hacking. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nChatterbox Text-to-Speech (GitHub Repo) \n\nResemble AI released an open-source TTS model that outperforms ElevenLabs in benchmarks and features emotion exaggeration controls. \nGlobal Illumination with RenderFormer (GitHub Repo) \n\nRenderFormer is a neural renderer that produces photorealistic images directly from triangle-based scene representations with full global illumination. It doesn't require any per-scene training or fine-tuning. \nWeb Bench - A new way to compare AI Browser Agents (7 minute read) \n\nWeb Bench is a new dataset for evaluating web browsing agents. It consists of 5,750 tasks on 452 different websites. Anthropic Sonnet 3.7 CUA is currently state-of-the-art according to Web Bench. \nCheaper VLM Training (GitHub Repo) \n\nMeta researchers introduced a method called zero-shot grafting, which trains a vision encoder with a smaller surrogate model derived from a large LLM's shallow layers. This reduces VLM training costs by ~45% while preserving or even improving performance when transferred to the full LLM. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nA recent clarity that I gained is viewing AI research as a “max-performance domain” (2 minute read) \n\n'Max-performance domains' are industries where people can be world-class by being very good at only one part of their job. It doesn't matter if you're incompetent at adjacent skills as long as you can create seminal impact. Exceptional ability at a single thing outweighs incompetence at other parts of the job. It is a luxury to work in a max-performance domain as failure is allowed and stress is usually self-imposed. \n1000x Increase in AI Demand (2 minute read) \n\nNVIDIA reports notable growth with a shift from simple AI to more complex reasoning, driving a massive increase in AI demand. Hyperscalers are deploying nearly 72,000 GPUs weekly, with Microsoft alone seeing a fivefold increase in token generation. Increased demand requires more data centers, termed \"AI factories,\" despite efforts to reduce model sizes. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nGoogle Releases MedGemma Medical AI Models (3 minute read) \n\nMedGemma is an open-source model built on Gemma 3 that comes in 4B multimodal and 27B text-only variants. \nHugging Face Unveils Two Fully Open-Source Humanoid Robots (2 minute read) \n\nJust a month after its acquisition of Pollen Robotics, Hugging Face has announced HopeJR, a full-size humanoid, and Reachy Mini, a desktop robot for testing AI applications. \nDelaware Scrutinizes OpenAI's For-Profit Shift (2 minute read) \n\nDelaware's attorney general has hired a bank to independently assess OpenAI's restructuring plan, potentially complicating the company's move to a for-profit model. \nElon Musk Tried to Block OpenAI's UAE AI Deal Over xAI Exclusion (2 minute read) \n\nElon Musk was frustrated that OpenAI, led by personal rival Sam Altman, was selected as a partner in the UAE AI campus deal. \nVibe coding platforms are blowing up (1 minute read) \n\nThe data shows that people are making things for themselves, not the world, but there is clearly builder excitement. \nThe Complete List of AI Coding Agents and IDEs (13 minute read) \n\nA developer tested 46 different AI coding tools, providing detailed comparisons and use cases for each platform. \nLove TLDR?

The company has scheduled mass production to begin as early as June. The new chips will be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000 to $12,000 the H20 sold for. The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nAttention Wasn't All We Needed (78 minute read) \n\nA lot of modern techniques have been developed since the original 'Attention Is All You Need' paper.

Exclusively working through tools allows models to externalize large parts of their intelligence to more efficient domain-specific programs. Some developers are already switching to a tool-use paradigm, but this is still limited to very short contexts and to only parts of the model output. This post provides examples of how the tool-use paradigm benefits different domains, like text editing, video understanding, and 3D generation. \nTraining-free Agent for App Automation (3 minute read) \n\nGUI-explorer is a training-free agent that autonomously explores and extracts knowledge from mobile app interfaces using unsupervised methods.

However, it was just a website - people didn't need to go buy a new device or wait for infrastructure to be deployed. Despite its advantages, ChatGPT's daily active users to weekly active users ratio is pretty bad. This may fix itself over time as models mature and more use cases emerge. The chatbot interface might only be working for some people and some use cases, so it might be better to wrap features and capabilities inside other things. \nOracle Will Buy $40B in Nvidia Chips for OpenAI's Stargate (2 minute read) \n\nOracle will purchase about 400,000 GB200 chips for the Stargate data center in Abilene, Texas. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nIt's hard to make scheming evals look realistic for LLMs (5 minute read) \n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet easily detects when it's being evaluated for scheming on the Apollo's scheming benchmark. \nTV Showcases Google's Veo AI Video Capabilities (5 minute read) \n\nFlow TV continuously streams user-generated AI video clips, and their associated prompts, organized into thematic channels. \nGemma 3n Architectural Innovations - Speculation and poking around in the model (3 minute read) \n\nA quick look at Gemma 3n, a new member of the Gemma family with free weights that was released during Google I/O. \nAnthropic and Legendary Music Producer Rick Rubin Publish Manuscript on Vibe Coding (45 minute read) \n\nBased on Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching, “The Way of Code” is a meditation on humility and creativity while vibe coding featuring interactive AI-generated visualizations. \nLove TLDR?

The live show combines theatrical techniques and James’ charismatic storytelling to create an evening of compelling intellectual entertainment. \nFrom Ice Age migrations to space travel, the stories of famous, infamous and unknown explorers will come to life in a theatric style, presented by British television presenter and award-winning journalist James May. James May is best known as a co-presenter of the motoring programs Top Gear and The Grand Tour, and as the host of the Our Man in… TV series. \nFew endeavors have captured the imagination and spirit of humanity as profoundly as exploration. Audiences will embark on an awe-inspiring journey through time and space. They will discover the stories of those who risked (and sometimes gave) everything, driven by insatiable curiosity and an unquenchable thirst for discovery, pushing back the boundaries of the unexplored regions of the world, and now, the universe. \nLive on stage, James May will unravel the breathtaking tales of humankind from the earliest wanderings of ancient hunter-gatherers to the intrepid, often obsessive explorers, among them Lief Ericson, John Cabot, James Cook’s navigator Tupaia, Stanley and Livingstone, Gertrude Bell, Burke and Wills, through to the moon walkers, space exploration and the seemingly impossible challenges of interplanetary and intergalactic travel.\n\n\n￼\nBOOK NOW\n￼\n￼ \n￼\n￼\n\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n\n3 Parsons Court, Wheeler Street, Cambridge, CB2 3QB\nEmail: tickets@cambridge.gov.uk\nPhone: 01223 357851\n*Please note: due to staffing and availability, there may be times when we are not able to open phonelines during stated hours.

Anthropic has emerged as the clear leader in the AI talent wars, maintaining an impressive 80% employee retention rate while aggressively poaching engineers from competitors. Talent is now 8 times more likely to leave OpenAI or DeepMind for Anthropic than move in the reverse direction. \nMinimal MCP + A2A Example (30 minute video) \n\nA toy example demonstrating the basics of Minimum Cost Path (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) ping checks. \nBuilding an agentic image generator that improves itself (6 minute read) \n\nLarge language models exhibit strong capabilities in natural language reasoning about visual imperfections, but they struggle to map these high-level insights into precise pixel-space action. The models excel when reasoning is constricted to discreet, well-scoped dimensions - performance degrades when they are asked to balance abstract aesthetic judgments with deterministic pixel-level corrections. This suggests that the models have trouble bridging symbolic understanding and spatial grounding, especially in iterative workflows that demand surgical image edits. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nAI Engineer World's Fair (Sponsor) \n\nThe world's biggest event for AI builders is in SF from June 3-5.

Their findings show that \"adversarial training\" - fine-tuning models on examples of malicious prompts - significantly improved Gemini 2.5's resistance without degrading performance on normal tasks. When they combined this approach with a \"Warning\" defense, attack success rates plummeted from 94.6% to just 6.2%. \nNew tools and features in the Responses API (6 minute read) \n\nOpenAI has added built-in tools and features to the Responses API. The API now has support for all remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and tools like image generation, Code Interpreter, and improvements to file search. It has new features that improve reliability, visibility, and privacy for enterprises and developers. All of these tools and features are now available in the Responses API, which supports the GPT‑4o series, GPT‑4.1 series, and o-series reasoning models. Image generation is only supported on o3 in the reasoning model series. \nLLM function calls don't scale; code orchestration is simpler, more effective. (5 minute read) \n\nGiving large language models the full output of tool calls is costly and slow. Output schemas enable developers to get structured data, which can then be processed. Using code execution as a way to process data from MCP tools opens the door to scaling the work of AI models. However, allowing an execution environment to also access MCPs, tools, and user data requires careful design as to where API keys are stored and how tools are exposed. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nFutureHouse's New AI System Successfully Identified a Novel Treatment for Leading Cause of Blindness (5 minute read) \n\nFutureHouse combined specialized literature search agents with a data analysis agent in a continuous experimental loop to accelerate medical discovery. The system autonomously generates hypotheses from literature reviews, proposes experiments for human execution, then analyzes resulting data to inform the next research cycle. Through this process, researchers identified ripasudil, an eye drop medication that relaxes cellular tension, as a promising new treatment for the leading cause of age-related vision loss, where retinal light-sensing cells gradually deteriorate. The complete code, data, and agent interaction traces will be publicly released on May 27. \nMy Prompt, My Reality (2 minute read) \n\nAI products depend heavily on user prompts, unlike traditional software with predictable outcomes.

The Gemini 2.5-powered tool clones entire repositories, then autonomously writes tests, fixes bugs, and builds features while developers work elsewhere. The agentic coding landscape is divided between synchronous pair-programming assistants and fully independent agents like Devin and Jules. \nExclusive: Google Sees Smart Glasses as the 'Next Frontier' for AI. And It's Not Working Alone (2 minute read) \n\nGoogle is reentering the smart glasses space with Android XR, integrating its Gemini AI to deliver real-time vision analysis, translation, and contextual assistance through AR glasses. The rollout will begin with Project Moohan, a mixed-reality headset built with Samsung, and followed by Project Aura, a developer-focused AR glasses prototype from Xreal, and future consumer AI glasses from partners like Warby Parker and Gentle Monster. \n‘Deep Think' boosts the performance of Google's flagship Google Gemini AI model (2 minute read) \n\nGoogle's Deep Think is an enhanced reasoning mode for the company's flagship Gemini 2.5 Pro model. It can consider multiple answers to questions before responding. Deep Think enabled Gemini 2.5 to top LifeCodeBench, a challenging coding evaluation, and it also beat OpenAI's o3 on MMMU, a test for skills like perception and reasoning. Google will be testing Deep Think with 'trusted testers' and conducting safety evaluations before rolling out the feature widely. \nApple will reportedly open up its local AI models to third-party apps (1 minute read) \n\nApple plans to open up its large language models via a software development kit (SDK) so developers can use them in their own apps. The SDK will initially only run Apple's smaller on-device models and won't allow developers to access the models running in the cloud. It will likely be announced during the Worldwide Developers Conference event scheduled to start on June 9. The event will also include an announcement for an overhaul of iOS, macOS, and iPadOS that will make them more unified and resemble the Vision Pro operating system. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nPoe Report Shows Rapid Shifts in AI Model Market Share (6 minute read) \n\nA report from Quora's multi-model chat platform Poe revealed dramatic shifts in AI model usage from January to May 2025, with OpenAI's GPT-4.1 family and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro quickly gaining popularity while Anthropic's Claude models declined.

Critics warn these partnerships could enable China to access restricted US AI technology through its extensive economic ties with Gulf states prompting new bipartisan legislation to prevent such transfers. \nIntroducing Codex (3 minute read) \n\nOpenAI just launched Codex, an autonomous coding agent that writes features, fixes bugs, and submits pull requests in isolated cloud environments. Companies like Cisco and Temporal are already using it to handle entire codebases while their engineers focus on higher-level work. The agent can tackle multiple tasks simultaneously, run tests, and provide detailed citations of every change it makes. \nAnthropic Receives $2.5 Billion, Five-year Credit Line from Wall Street (2 minute read) \n\nAnthropic has secured a new line of credit to further accelerate its growth, adding to the $18.2 billion already raised from investors. The company reported that its annualized revenue doubled to $2 billion in the last 6 months. The move mirrors OpenAI's strategy, which established a $4 billion revolving credit line last October. \n🧠\nDeep Dives & Analysis\nLarge Language Models Are More Persuasive Than Incentivized Human Persuaders (35 minute read) \n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet significantly outperformed human persuaders in a controlled experiment where both attempted to influence participants' answers on quiz questions. Claude achieved 7.6% higher success rates when trying to convince participants to select specific answers and was more effective both at promoting correct answers (+12.2%) and incorrect answers (-15.1%). \nHow Hardware Limitations Have, and Will, Prevent Rapid AI Takeoffs (8 minute read) \n\nMajor algorithmic breakthroughs for LLMs, like the transformer architecture, multi-query attention, and mixture-of-experts systems, only demonstrate substantial benefits (10-50x performance gains) when implemented with massive amounts of compute. This challenges predictions of rapid AI self-improvement since hardware constraints like chip export controls, power consumption limits, and cooling infrastructure bottlenecks would significantly limit any \"intelligence explosion\" scenario. \nSuperhuman Coders in AI 2027 (9 minute read) \n\nSuperhuman coding by AI will likely occur by 2033, later than AI Futures' estimates of 2028-2030. This delay is due to factors like handling engineering complexity, working without feedback loops, and achieving cost and speed. Unforeseen challenges, such as geopolitical issues or changes in lab priorities, could further push out timelines. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nAI Engineer World's Fair (Sponsor) \n\nThe world's biggest event for AI builders is in SF from June 3-5.

It is trained on ChatReward-30K, a dataset containing diverse preference-labeled audio interactions. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nOpenAI announces $250K Prize for Using Their Models to Find Lost Amazonian Cities (2 minute read) \n\nThe challenge invites competitors to use o3, o4-mini, and GPT-4.1 models with open-source data to pinpoint undiscovered archaeological sites in the Amazon by June 29. Winners will receive funding to verify their findings in the field alongside archaeologists. \nGenerative AI Adoption Index (2 minute read) \n\nOrganizations are prioritizing generative AI over security spending for 2025. Companies are creating leadership roles like Chief AI Officer and adopting aggressive hiring and internal development strategies for AI talent. Many are using a hybrid model, combining off-the-shelf AI models with custom applications using proprietary data. \nThere should be no AI button (3 minute read) \n\nThe \"AI button\" UX pattern is limiting and creates unnecessary distinctions between AI-assisted and manual workflows. Better alternatives, like integrating AI as a \"shadow teammate\" within workflows, enhance collaboration without fragmenting user experience. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nStability AI and Arm Release Low Latency Audio Model for On-Device Audio Generation (2 minute read) \n\nStability AI is open-sourcing Stable Audio Open Small, a 341 million parameter text-to-audio model optimized to run on Arm CPUs. \nCohere Acquired Ottogrid (1 minute read) \n\nCohere has acquired Ottogrid, a Canadian startup focused on automating enterprise market research workflows. \nApple-Alibaba Deal Under U.S. Scrutiny (1 minute read) \n\nU.S. lawmakers raised concerns over Apple's reported partnership with Alibaba, questioning the handling of user data and transparency amid rising U.S.-China tech tensions. \nLove TLDR?

When their synchronous image generation system couldn't handle the unexpected load, the team quickly rewrote the entire architecture to an asynchronous model mid-launch. \nAgents, Tools, and Simulators (15 minute read) \n\nAI can be viewed through three conceptual lenses, each providing distinct insights into its capabilities and risks: as a tool, an agent, or a simulator. While tools extend human intentions and require control, agents pursue goals independently, and simulators mimic processes without specific objectives. For LLMs, simulator theory suggests they blend simulation with agent-like behavior, especially when fine-tuned, indicating a dual nature influenced by their operating context and architecture. \nHow AI Agents Will Change the Web for Users and Developers (11 minute read) \n\nAI agents will transform the web by autonomously interacting and exchanging content, significantly altering both user experience and web development practices. This may result in an \"autonomous internet\" where AI agents dominate interactions, prompting changes in content presentation, payment systems, and business models. Developers need to adapt by creating APIs for AI agents and focusing on personalized, scalable user experiences. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Research\nNous Research's Psyche Network Taps Idle GPUs for AI Training (14 minute read) \n\nPsyche is a Solana-based distributed training system that allows anyone with compatible hardware to volunteer their GPUs for AI model training.

(Some regular competitive teams have dedicated channels to discuss tactics beforehand) but if you have any questions please ask or DM any Rhino you have spoken with and they will help you or point you in the right direction.\n​\nMake sure you click the RacePass in the team sheet ASAP and are registered for the event. You have to sign up to the RacePass before that TimeZone begins, but so long as you have then you don’t actually have to join the event Race Pen in Zwift up until a few minutes before your official start time. However, it's always recommended to be in the Race Pen and in the Team Voice Channel 5-10 minutes before your start time.\n​\nYou can confirm you’ve signed up correctly using the RacePass, as you should then see the TTT event on the home screen of your Zwift Companion App listed under Events.\nChange kit to the Rhino jersey (if you have it - if you are new it might take a week for Gordon to get it unlocked for you).\n Make sure you select a TT bike from your garage!! If you want to look at the fastest bike setup, try Zwifter Bikes and use the settings to adjust for the course, your Zwift level, your Drops level and FTP and weight etc.\nZWIFTER BIKES\n￼\nAdd (Rhino) after your Zwift name (this can be done in the Companion App settings).\nAt least 10 minutes before your event start time, please log on to Zwift (in case of software updates) and join the Discord Team Voice Channel of the team name you are riding with (Albino, Thundering, Rapids, Nuclear etc) meet your teammates, discuss a plan, make sure everyone is ready etc.\n​\nPlease check your discord if you have not used it before (turn on noise suppression in settings to remove trainer/fan noise).\n​\nThe aim is to stay with the group, always in the draft. If you are stronger rider do more work on the front. If weak just try hang on in the draft. Sometimes a race is just too fast and riders need to be dropped (especially for experienced teams going for the win).\n​\nFor teams of 5 or more, the team time is taken from 4th rider to cross the line. For teams of 3 or 4, it is from the 3rd rider crossing the line.\n​\nDon't feel bad if you get dropped just continue the race at your own pace but please DON'T INTERFERE OR TRY DRAFTING OTHER TEAMS. If another team passes you then it is respectful to ease your power for 10-20s until they are passed and a few seconds clear of you.\n​\nIf you finding that you are not enjoying the TTTs and maybe getting put in a team that drops you each week then please feel free to comment on sign up form – you can ask for an easier ride, a harder ride – we are always flexible to try place riders in a team that suits their needs.\n Communication is key, don’t be afraid to talk to your team even if you are new and learning - if you see the group stretching try call it out when you see gaps of 3-4 meters before it gets to 5+ and out the draft. If you can’t last any longer then tell them you are dropping so that they know to carry on etc.\n​\nWe are all racing to have fun and there are some very experienced TTT riders active in ⁠ttt-chat who are happy to answer any and all questions.\n​\nSupport your teammates and have fun. Remember it’s a Team Time Trial!  \n \nThere are lots of videos in streaming links on the Rhino Racing Discord server to see how a TTT is done if you would like to have a look beforehand.\n​\nWell done on getting to the end of this and remember...

(Some regular competitive teams have dedicated channels to discuss tactics beforehand) but if you have any questions please ask or DM any Rhino you have spoken with and they will help you or point you in the right direction.\n​\nMake sure you click the RacePass in the team sheet ASAP and are registered for the event. You have to sign up to the RacePass before that TimeZone begins, but so long as you have then you don’t actually have to join the event Race Pen in Zwift up until a few minutes before your official start time. However, it's always recommended to be in the Race Pen and in the Team Voice Channel 5-10 minutes before your start time.\n​\nYou can confirm you’ve signed up correctly using the RacePass, as you should then see the TTT event on the home screen of your Zwift Companion App listed under Events.\nChange kit to the Rhino jersey (if you have it - if you are new it might take a week for Gordon to get it unlocked for you).\n Make sure you select a TT bike from your garage!! If you want to look at the fastest bike setup, try Zwifter Bikes and use the settings to adjust for the course, your Zwift level, your Drops level and FTP and weight etc.\nZWIFTER BIKES\n￼\nAdd (Rhino) after your Zwift name (this can be done in the Companion App settings).\nAt least 10 minutes before your event start time, please log on to Zwift (in case of software updates) and join the Discord Team Voice Channel of the team name you are riding with (Albino, Thundering, Rapids, Nuclear etc) meet your teammates, discuss a plan, make sure everyone is ready etc.\n​\nPlease check your discord if you have not used it before (turn on noise suppression in settings to remove trainer/fan noise).\n​\nThe aim is to stay with the group, always in the draft. If you are stronger rider do more work on the front. If weak just try hang on in the draft. Sometimes a race is just too fast and riders need to be dropped (especially for experienced teams going for the win).\n​\nFor teams of 5 or more, the team time is taken from 4th rider to cross the line. For teams of 3 or 4, it is from the 3rd rider crossing the line.\n​\nDon't feel bad if you get dropped just continue the race at your own pace but please DON'T INTERFERE OR TRY DRAFTING OTHER TEAMS. If another team passes you then it is respectful to ease your power for 10-20s until they are passed and a few seconds clear of you.\n​\nIf you finding that you are not enjoying the TTTs and maybe getting put in a team that drops you each week then please feel free to comment on sign up form – you can ask for an easier ride, a harder ride – we are always flexible to try place riders in a team that suits their needs.\n Communication is key, don’t be afraid to talk to your team even if you are new and learning - if you see the group stretching try call it out when you see gaps of 3-4 meters before it gets to 5+ and out the draft. If you can’t last any longer then tell them you are dropping so that they know to carry on etc.\n​\nWe are all racing to have fun and there are some very experienced TTT riders active in ⁠ttt-chat who are happy to answer any and all questions.\n​\nSupport your teammates and have fun. Remember it’s a Team Time Trial!  \n \nThere are lots of videos in streaming links on the Rhino Racing Discord server to see how a TTT is done if you would like to have a look beforehand.\n​\nWell done on getting to the end of this and remember...

(1 minute read) \n\nAI performance on long tasks follows a simple model with a constant failure rate, creating an exponential decline in success. Each AI agent can be characterized by a \"half-life\" that estimates success over varying task lengths. This model suggests failures arise from complex sets of subtasks. \nSeparating Fact from Fiction: Here's How AI Is Transforming Cybercrime (6 minute read) \n\nAI in cybersecurity primarily enhances existing techniques rather than creating new threats and lowers entry barriers for cybercriminals. At the recent RSA Conference, experts highlighted AI's role in automating tasks and facilitating advanced cybercrime models like AI-as-a-Service. Future defenses will require AI-driven strategies and international collaboration to effectively combat evolving threats. \nThe Leaderboard Illusion (1 minute read) \n\nChatbot Arena's benchmarking exhibits bias due to undisclosed private testing and selective data access.

Unlike the previous manual explicit caching method, this automatic feature could ease developer concerns about unexpected API costs. However, developers should monitor its effectiveness, as Google hasn't provided third-party verification for the cost savings claims. \nAI-generated code could be a disaster for the software supply chain. Here's why (4 minute read) \n\nAI-generated code often includes non-existent library references, exposing systems to supply-chain attacks via dependency confusion. A study found 19.7% of dependencies from tested LLMs were fabricated, creating security risks. Open-source LLMs hallucinate more frequently than commercial ones, with JavaScript showing higher error rates than Python. \nHugging Face releases a free Operator-like agentic AI tool (2 minute read) \n\nHugging Face's Open Computer Agent is a cloud-hosted AI agent capable of basic tasks but struggles with complex requests like flight searches.

We split into 3 small groups this year but found each other towards the end of the ride.\n \nWe were diverted this year due to a closed road where there’s been wild fires on the heath which is sad but we quickly carried on. The diversion did mean we had a steeper (but shorter) ‘hill’ to climb. The ‘hill’ was an extra 343ft at 12.6% and .52 miles long. The segment is called ‘Goyt’s Lane - Straight of Pain’!! 🤣  \nThe diversion took us into Buxton which was a nice change, to all the cafes which worked out perfect for a mid ride stop. My group found a very nice cafe serving vegan food, the vegan burger was a winner.\n Well done to everyone that came along for the ride and thanks for being so awesome.\n \nSorry not to include everyone in the photo mash up, I did the best I could with the ones sent to me.

Simply input MIDI to create stunning violin performances that sound like they’re played by human masters, without the need for bulky sample libraries.\n \nThe current AI instrument model is still in beta and doesn’t support articulations or emotion controls just yet, but these features are coming soon. Plus, more instruments are on the way!\n￼\n￼\n \nFeature 2: MIDI Device Input\n \nSinger and Instrument tracks now support MIDI device input. For added flexibility, you can also use your computer keyboard as a MIDI input. \n \nFeature 3: AAX Plugin Support\n \nACE Bridge now supports the AAX plugin format! For Windows users, it will be installed automatically with the update. Mac users will be prompted to install it after updating.\n \nFeature 4: Improved Voice Changer\n \nThe performance of our voice changer model has been significantly improved. If you use custom voice changer models, you can retrain them to take advantage of the updates.

Following our updates last week regarding our missing student, Mihran, you may well be aware from police updates and from news and media outlets over the weekend that the search ended on Saturday 26th April in the worst of all outcomes. \n \nBelow is the email that we have sent to all current students today to alert them to the news and to outline the extra support from wellbeing and counselling colleagues. We have additional hours on site this week from our talking therapy professionals so that we can begin to support students and staff to process what has happened here.\n \nWhere we are aware of individuals who are particular friends of Mihran, we have been reaching out to them specifically and each of Mihranâ€™s Monday classes and enrichment groups have been spoken to today, with wellbeing colleagues on hand, to ensure that we can support them specifically. \n \nWe are receiving professional support too based on dealing with trauma and their key advice is for us to focus on allowing our young people to feel: safe, calm, connected, in control and hopeful. Our team will be doing all they can to provide that reassurance. Your support with this and with helping us to reach out to any young person about whom you have concerns would be much appreciated. \n \nThank you for the kind and thoughtful messages that we have received from a few parents today. I cannot tell you how it helps. \n \nThe message that students received mid morning is below:\n \nDear Students\n \nFollowing extensive searches last week and support from the whole community, I am so very, very sorry to have to let you know that everyoneâ€™s worst fears were realised on Saturday morning. Police have confirmed that missing Y12 student Mihran Khachatryan died by suicide in countryside near Caldecote. Their investigation is ongoing. \n \nHills Road students and colleagues were part of the incredible public effort to find Mihran and I know how much we all wanted a different ending here. Hills Road staff will be supporting the police and family in their quest to understand what has happened. In respect to Mihran and his family and to all those who knew and loved him, please do not be tempted to speculate yourself or to give oxygen to the speculation of others. No one has any understanding of what happened here. That doesnâ€™t mean we shouldnâ€™t seek to understand or to adjust practice wherever that could be helpful. Of course that must happen. But it does mean that there are members of our community hurting very badly just now. The further hurt caused by uninformed opinion and judgement, most especially to his family, is therefore deeply unwarranted.\n \nAs we approach exam season for both year groups we want you to know that every single member of the Hills Road staff team wants nothing more than for each one of you to thrive. That means taking care of your mental and physical health first and foremost. Education is about so many things, only one of which is qualifications. Most of all, we want you all to go on to be happy and healthy adults who are confident and comfortable in who you are; what you know and how you want to live your life. Qualifications are not the end goal of education. They are simply the passport to the next stage. And if that does not happen first time, then there will always be another chance, another way and another path.\n \nAnd right now, we want to support you in any way you need as you navigate these next few days and weeks. Additional wellbeing support is available every day this week, accessed via the wellbeing rooms on the guidance corridor or through Student Services. We have an additional student counsellor starting today and additional wellbeing and counselling support. Your tutor and teachers stand ready to help you and Mihranâ€™s classmates and friends, in particular, will have additional support offered, including today as each class meets. Out of hours there is always a listening ear available via the Samaritans at www.samaritans.org and all of our in house resources about routes to access help are here: Student Support and Guidance site.\n \nWhether you knew Mihran personally or not, I know that this news will potentially be upsetting and unsettling, not least as we very much hold Sriram in our thoughts too. \n \nPlease know that each of you is special, valued and unique. \n \nTake care of yourselves and please reach out for any support you need: it is here for you. \n \nJo Trump\n \n \n \n\n\n\nPlease consider the environment and don't print this email unless you really need to.\n",    "sending_date_time": "Monday, 28 April 2025 at 19:03:59"  },  {    "subject": "DeepSeek-R2 2️⃣, xAI raises $20B 💰, Debug ML Deployments Faster 💻",    "sender": "TLDR AI <dan@tldrnewsletter.com>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": "Sign Up |Advertise|View Online \nTLDR \n\nTogether With ￼\nTLDR AI 2025-04-28\nWhy Your GenAI Interface Might Need More Friction, Not Less (Sponsor) \n\nThe standard UX playbook says, \"reduce friction at all costs,\" but with genAI systems, this conventional wisdom might not always hold true.

View in browser\n \n￼\n\nThanks for registering.\n\nIf you are new to Team Time Trials then have a read of the below - it will give you all the info needed to get lined up in the pen with your fellow team mates.\n​\nPlease remember that everyone is equally important to the team, the keyword is Team!\n  \nThere are 2 forms used for TTT’s, you have obviously found the first as you made your way here...⁠ \n The sign-up form (that you've just filled in) is available each week on Friday and is where you can select your availability for the following Thursday - timezone availability, including a comments section if you want to request an easy ride, harder ride etc.\n The team-sheet is usually finalised on a Wednesday afternoon / evening and confirmed via a message in ⁠ttt-chat on the Rhino Racing Discord server (all riders will get tagged - as long as we have your discord tag).\nThe team sheet confirms which team you are on and who you ride with.\nTEAM SHEET\n￼\nYou need to click the RacePass link for your team, and you need to have a registered WTRL account:\nWTRL REGISTRATION\n￼\nMost teams have a chat beforehand if needed, in the ⁠ttt-chat channel. (Some regular competitive teams have dedicated channels to discuss tactics beforehand) but if you have any questions please ask or DM any Rhino you have spoken with and they will help you or point you in the right direction.\n​\nMake sure you click the RacePass in the team sheet ASAP and are registered for the event. You have to sign up to the RacePass before that TimeZone begins, but so long as you have then you don’t actually have to join the event Race Pen in Zwift up until a few minutes before your official start time. However, it's always recommended to be in the Race Pen and in the Team Voice Channel 5-10 minutes before your start time.\n​\nYou can confirm you’ve signed up correctly using the RacePass, as you should then see the TTT event on the home screen of your Zwift Companion App listed under Events.\nChange kit to the Rhino jersey (if you have it - if you are new it might take a week for Gordon to get it unlocked for you).\n Make sure you select a TT bike from your garage!! If you want to look at the fastest bike setup, try Zwifter Bikes and use the settings to adjust for the course, your Zwift level, your Drops level and FTP and weight etc.\nZWIFTER BIKES\n￼\nAdd (Rhino) after your Zwift name (this can be done in the Companion App settings).\nAt least 10 minutes before your event start time, please log on to Zwift (in case of software updates) and join the Discord Team Voice Channel of the team name you are riding with (Albino, Thundering, Rapids, Nuclear etc) meet your teammates, discuss a plan, make sure everyone is ready etc.\n​\nPlease check your discord if you have not used it before (turn on noise suppression in settings to remove trainer/fan noise).\n​\nThe aim is to stay with the group, always in the draft. If you are stronger rider do more work on the front. If weak just try hang on in the draft. Sometimes a race is just too fast and riders need to be dropped (especially for experienced teams going for the win).\n​\nFor teams of 5 or more, the team time is taken from 4th rider to cross the line. For teams of 3 or 4, it is from the 3rd rider crossing the line.\n​\nDon't feel bad if you get dropped just continue the race at your own pace but please DON'T INTERFERE OR TRY DRAFTING OTHER TEAMS. If another team passes you then it is respectful to ease your power for 10-20s until they are passed and a few seconds clear of you.\n​\nIf you finding that you are not enjoying the TTTs and maybe getting put in a team that drops you each week then please feel free to comment on sign up form – you can ask for an easier ride, a harder ride – we are always flexible to try place riders in a team that suits their needs.\n Communication is key, don’t be afraid to talk to your team even if you are new and learning - if you see the group stretching try call it out when you see gaps of 3-4 meters before it gets to 5+ and out the draft. If you can’t last any longer then tell them you are dropping so that they know to carry on etc.\n​\nWe are all racing to have fun and there are some very experienced TTT riders active in ⁠ttt-chat who are happy to answer any and all questions.\n​\nSupport your teammates and have fun. Remember it’s a Team Time Trial!  \n \nThere are lots of videos in streaming links on the Rhino Racing Discord server to see how a TTT is done if you would like to have a look beforehand.\n​\nWell done on getting to the end of this and remember... Have fun... the type 2 kind!\n \nThis email was sent from this site.\nIf you no longer wish to receive this email, change your email preferences here.\n",    "sending_date_time": "Sunday, 27 April 2025 at 22:13:00"  },  {    "subject": "Everyone has signed 8TT RM  4 DM draft tenancy agreement",    "sender": "Dropbox Sign <noreply@mail.hellosign.com>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": " \n￼ \n\n \n \n￼\n \n￼\nEveryone has signed 8TT RM 4 DM draft tenancy agreement \n￼\n￼\nSIGNERS \nDivine Maxwell (divinemaxwell@yahoo.com) \nClaire Pembery (claire@pembery.com) \n \nYou can view the document as an attachment below (if it’s under 25 MB).

Synthesizer V Studio is unique in its use of, and ability to manipulate, real vocal recordings rather than relying on trained AI to do the same job.”\nMusic Radar - February 2025\n￼\n“ Since its initial release, Synthesizer V has provided musicians with a tool for generating and refining vocal performances. The software enables users to input melodies, write lyrics, and select from a variety of AI-driven vocalists while customising expressive details. With this new version, Dreamtonics has introduced a series of enhancements designed to improve realism, workflow efficiency, and creative control.”\nAttack Magazine - February 2025\n￼\n“ At the NAMM Show 2025, Tokyo-based Dreamtonics were showcasing the latest version of their innovative vocal synthesis software. Dreamtonics have re-trained the underlying AI and carefully reworked the Vocal Modes available for each voice to enhance their stylistic distinction, a move which not only improves the quality of each voice, but also prepares them for the new level of detailed edits offered by version 2. ”\nSound On Sound Magazine - February 2025\n￼\nWhat top professionals are saying about Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro\n \n \n“ I think Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro is a real breakthrough for creating vocal melodies and writing lyrics. I was blessed to be able to sing anything I can dream up, but so many people don’t have the ability. I was surprised how quickly I was able to get up and running. The midi functionality is a real game-changer. Being able to play in my melodies and then just copy lyrics from the previous take was seamless. This is a great app and plugin!”\nMischke Butler - Singer, Songwriter, Vocal Producer, Vocal Coach & Vocal Arranger (Michael Jackson, The Spice Girls, Britney Spears, Keke Palmer, and Little Mix)\n￼\n\"Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro is an incredibly useful tool for song writing and vocal production.\" Chris Garcia - Vocal Producer & Music Producer (Adel, Dua Lipa, Lana Del Rey, Katie Perry, Christina Aguilera, Celine Dion)\n￼\n\"Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro by Dreamtonics is an outstanding breakthrough in vocal modeling. For me it’s an almost futuristic dream come true. Input notes via MIDI, type some words and then pick your vocalist!

View in a browser\n \n￼\n\nThanks for registering.\n\nIf you are new to Team Time Trials then have a read of the below - it will give you all the info needed to get lined up in the pen with your fellow team mates.\n​\nPlease remember that everyone is equally important to the team, the keyword is Team!\n  \nThere are 2 forms used for TTT’s, you have obviously found the first as you made your way here...⁠ \n The sign-up form (that you've just filled in) is available each week on Friday and is where you can select your availability for the following Thursday - timezone availability, including a comments section if you want to request an easy ride, harder ride etc.\n The team-sheet is usually finalised on a Wednesday afternoon / evening and confirmed via a message in ⁠ttt-chat on the Rhino Racing Discord server (all riders will get tagged - as long as we have your discord tag).\nThe team sheet confirms which team you are on and who you ride with.\nTEAM SHEET\n￼\nYou need to click the RacePass link for your team, and you need to have a registered WTRL account:\nWTRL REGISTRATION\n￼\nMost teams have a chat beforehand if needed, in the ⁠ttt-chat channel. (Some regular competitive teams have dedicated channels to discuss tactics beforehand) but if you have any questions please ask or DM any Rhino you have spoken with and they will help you or point you in the right direction.\n​\nMake sure you click the RacePass in the team sheet ASAP and are registered for the event. You have to sign up to the RacePass before that TimeZone begins, but so long as you have then you don’t actually have to join the event Race Pen in Zwift up until a few minutes before your official start time. However, it's always recommended to be in the Race Pen and in the Team Voice Channel 5-10 minutes before your start time.\n​\nYou can confirm you’ve signed up correctly using the RacePass, as you should then see the TTT event on the home screen of your Zwift Companion App listed under Events.\nChange kit to the Rhino jersey (if you have it - if you are new it might take a week for Gordon to get it unlocked for you).\n Make sure you select a TT bike from your garage!! If you want to look at the fastest bike setup, try Zwifter Bikes and use the settings to adjust for the course, your Zwift level, your Drops level and FTP and weight etc.\nZWIFTER BIKES\n￼\nAdd (Rhino) after your Zwift name (this can be done in the Companion App settings).\nAt least 10 minutes before your event start time, please log on to Zwift (in case of software updates) and join the Discord Team Voice Channel of the team name you are riding with (Albino, Thundering, Rapids, Nuclear etc) meet your teammates, discuss a plan, make sure everyone is ready etc.\n​\nPlease check your discord if you have not used it before (turn on noise suppression in settings to remove trainer/fan noise).\n​\nThe aim is to stay with the group, always in the draft. If you are stronger rider do more work on the front. If weak just try hang on in the draft. Sometimes a race is just too fast and riders need to be dropped (especially for experienced teams going for the win).\n​\nFor teams of 5 or more, the team time is taken from 4th rider to cross the line. For teams of 3 or 4, it is from the 3rd rider crossing the line.\n​\nDon't feel bad if you get dropped just continue the race at your own pace but please DON'T INTERFERE OR TRY DRAFTING OTHER TEAMS. If another team passes you then it is respectful to ease your power for 10-20s until they are passed and a few seconds clear of you.\n​\nIf you finding that you are not enjoying the TTTs and maybe getting put in a team that drops you each week then please feel free to comment on sign up form – you can ask for an easier ride, a harder ride – we are always flexible to try place riders in a team that suits their needs.\n Communication is key, don’t be afraid to talk to your team even if you are new and learning - if you see the group stretching try call it out when you see gaps of 3-4 meters before it gets to 5+ and out the draft. If you can’t last any longer then tell them you are dropping so that they know to carry on etc.\n​\nWe are all racing to have fun and there are some very experienced TTT riders active in ⁠ttt-chat who are happy to answer any and all questions.\n​\nSupport your teammates and have fun. Remember it’s a Team Time Trial!  \n \nThere are lots of videos in streaming links on the Rhino Racing Discord server to see how a TTT is done if you would like to have a look beforehand.\n​\nWell done on getting to the end of this and remember... Have fun... the type 2 kind!\n \nThis email was sent from this site.\nIf you no longer wish to receive this email, change your email preferences here.\n￼ ",    "sending_date_time": "Sunday, 13 April 2025 at 12:37:25"  },  {    "subject": "Special delivery: Courier",    "sender": "London Mole <info@london-mole.com>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": "Our most stylish new arrival \n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\nEdit preferences or Unsubscribe\n",    "sending_date_time": "Sunday, 13 April 2025 at 10:30:09"  },  {    "subject": "Daily Rundown: The rise of…",    "sender": "LinkedIn <notifications-noreply@linkedin.com>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": "Here’s what’s happened since you were last on LinkedIn

It brings smarter text interpretation, better image coherence, and introduces Draft Mode for fast, low-cost iterations with optional voice commands and personalization. \nCyberattacks by AI agents are coming (7 minute read) \n\nAI agents are emerging as potent tools in cybersecurity capable of executing complex attacks and potentially scaling operations like ransomware. The LLM Agent Honeypot project aims to detect these agents by simulating vulnerable servers. Its work has revealed that agents can adapt and avoid detection better than traditional bots. Experts anticipate an increase in agent-driven cyberattacks, urging preemptive development of defenses as these technologies evolve. \n🧠\nResearch & Innovation\nUnsupervised Panoptic Segmentation (3 minute read) \n\nCUPS is a new method for panoptic segmentation without labeled data that leverages depth and motion cues to train directly on scene-centric images. \nRope to Nope: Hybrid Attention for Long Context (25 minute read) \n\nThe key innovation that enabled Llama 4 to reach 10m+ tokens in context is the alternation between no positional embeddings and rotational positional embeddings. While there are only have benchmarks on Needle in the Haystack, it seems to be a strong confirmation of performance of alternating layers. \nInference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling (31 minute read) \n\nThis paper from DeepSeek talks about how to use inference time scaling to make reward modeling better to bootstrap stronger reasoners. It hints at a broader strategy from the Chinese start-up to use its existing reasoning models as the base for a new generation of reward models to train the next generation of reasoners. \n🧑‍💻\nEngineering & Resources\nGenerative Modeling for Crystals (GitHub Repo) \n\nCrystalFormer is a transformer model that generates crystal structures using space group symmetry, making crystal generation more efficient and data-friendly. \nNano Aha Moment (GitHub Repo) \n\nA single file, single GPU, from scratch full parameter tuning library that replicates DeepSeek R1-Zero style training. \nObject Counting (GitHub Repo) \n\nA fully automated zero-shot object counting method leveraging feature maps and self-attention mechanisms that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the FSC147 dataset. \n🎁\nMiscellaneous\nDeepSeek 1.58bit GGUF (Hugging Face Hub) \n\nThe unsloth folks have figured out which piece of the new R1 model can be properly quantized. They also found some tokenizer quirks to be aware of, which make quantization slightly harder. In summary, just the MoE layers go to 1.58 bit while everything else remains in 4 or 6 with their dynamic quantization scheme. \nAI masters Minecraft: DeepMind program finds diamonds without being taught (5 minute read) \n\nDeepMind's AI system, Dreamer, successfully learned to collect diamonds in Minecraft without prior human guidance, highlighting a step towards general AI systems. Using reinforcement learning, Dreamer independently explores and builds a model of the game environment to predict future actions and outcomes. This advancement suggests potential applications for AI in real-world scenarios where trial and error are costly. \nThe artifact isn't the art: Rethinking creativity in the age of AI (6 minute read) \n\nAI-generated Ghibli-style visuals have surged in popularity, straining OpenAI's servers and sparking debates about creativity in the AI age. While AI can rapidly produce artistic images, it lacks the human ability to experience and synthesize complex ideas and emotions. The future of creativity will focus on meaningful outputs shaped by human insight and purpose, with AI as a tool rather than a creator. \n⚡\nQuick Links\nGranite Speech 8B (Hugging Face Hub) \n\nIBM silently launched a state-of-the-art speech recognition and understanding model based on its Granite series. \nStart building with Gemini 2.5 Pro (1 minute read) \n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.5 Pro is now in public preview via the Gemini API on Google AI Studio, with Vertex AI availability coming soon. \nOpenAI's models 'memorized' copyrighted content, new study suggests (3 minute read) \n\nA study suggested that OpenAI trained its models on copyrighted content without permission. \nLove TLDR?

All companies must, at all times, have an ‘appropriate address’ as their registered office.        \nThere’s also a new requirement for all companies to give a registered email address to Companies House. \nYou must keep your registered office address and your registered email address up to date to make sure you receive important information from Companies House.  \nWe may take action against the company and its officers if you do not meet these requirements. \nFor more information about the new rules for registered office addresses and the new registered email address, read our guidance on GOV. UK.    \n\nNew financial penalties   \nWe introduced new financial penalties in October 2024. You may receive a financial penalty if you do not comply with your legal obligations – for example, not filing your confirmation statement on time.  \nWe’ll introduce more financial penalties for non-compliance as and when new measures come into force.   \nRead more about how we’ll use our enforcement powers to issue financial penalties.  \nSign up for email reminders to remind you when your confirmation statement is due.   \n\nGet ready for identity verification\nAnyone setting up, running, owning or controlling a company in the UK will soon need to verify their identity to prove they are who they claim to be.   \nYou’ll be able to verify using GOV. UK One Login, or through an Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP). \nTo get ready for identity verification, it’s important to make sure we hold the correct details for each officer and person with significant control (PSC) of your company.   \nYou will not be able to complete identity verification if the personal information on your identity documents, such as your date of birth, does not match the information held on our register.  \nCheck the details we hold for you and your company on the Find and update company information service.   \nYou can tell us about some changes online. For other changes, such as incorrect or missing information about directors or PSCs on your incorporation documents, you'll need to file a paper form. \nIn the future, identity verification will become compulsory. From this point, if you or any other directors do not comply with identity verification requirements on time, you’ll be committing an offence and will not be able to make any filings for your company. There’ll be a range of consequences, including a financial penalty and being unable to start a new company.  \n\nRegister as an Authorised Corporate Service Provider\nThird-party providers such as agents or accountants, who wish to carry out identity verification checks on behalf of clients for Companies House, can now register their business as an Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP).   \nTo become an ACSP, also known as a Companies House authorised agent, third-party providers must be supervised within the UK by a relevant Anti-Money Laundering (AML) supervisory body.   \nTo register as an ACSP, third-party providers will need to use our 'Apply to register as a Companies House authorised agent' service. \nRead more about what it means to be an ACSP.\n\nChanges to accounts\nThe online accounts and Company Tax Return service is closing on 31 March 2026. \nIf you use this service to file your accounts with Companies House and Company Tax Return with HMRC, you’ll need to find alternative filing methods once it closes. \nOver the next 2 to 3 years, we’ll be transitioning towards filing accounts by software only.  \nWe’re preparing a detailed timetable and we aim to give companies 21 months’ notice ahead of the change. Most companies can make the change now as software is already available. We’ve published an updated version of our Find software for filing company accounts tool to help companies to choose a suitable software product. \n\nHow to keep up to date\nRead all the latest updates on our Changes to UK company law website and sign up for our regular email newsletters.   \n\nYou’ve received this email because you provided this registered email address to Companies House.

And make sure you save the date for the leavers’ event on 26 June!\n \nKeep the next few weeks in perspective and keep focused on your goals. There is no outcome that could happen that will mean there is no path forward for you. There is always a path! Keep going and keep your eyes on the horizon and on those opportunities ahead. You will be just fine.\n \nAnd do take a look at the latest edition of Hills News for a snapshot of all the amazing things you’ve all been up to this past term from the magical Corn Exchange evening back in March to this week’s sunshiny fun run.

There is distinct value to focused revision that is guided by a teacher and supported by the knowledge and combined expertise of your whole class.  It is in these lessons that teachers can draw your attention to common student errors and remind you of important exam advice. All timetabled lessons and support sessions remain compulsory, and count towards your overall attendance percentage.\n \n￼\n \nAll the indications from the March Progress Reviews are that as a year group you are making good progress in your A Level subjects – well done! We are confident that, as a year group, you are well placed for your exams in May and June.  Keep acting on the advice and feedback you received from teachers and make use of all the subject workshops and other support on offer.\n \n￼\n \nYou will have received your exam timetable by email several weeks ago.  Please continue to check carefully for further information from the Exams Office as the exams draw nearer.  Teaching will finish at the end of the day on Friday May 9th, with public exams starting the following a week in some subjects.\n \nThis year, it is the case in that a significant amount of the examined assessment will be completed by May half-term in numerous subjects, a trend that has emerged since the return to exams after the pandemic.  Business, Classical Civilisation, Combined English, Economics, English Language, English Literature, Film Studies, Geography, History, History of Art, Media Studies, Music Technology, PE, Philosophy, Psychology, Philosophy, Music Technology and AS Further Maths will all have held between 50% and 100% of the examination element of their final qualification by May half-term so do plan your revision to take this in to account.\n \nFinally, don’t forget that you need to keep the afternoon of Wednesday 11 June, along with all day Wednesday 25 June free as these are the national exams contingency sessions.  Awarding bodies will make use of these days were it to be necessary to postpone any exams for any reason and reschedule them.  It is an arrangement that is put in place every year, so no leaving the country on holiday until after these dates please!\n \n￼\n \nFriday\n9\nMay\nFinal day of teaching\nMonday\n12\nMay\nStudy leave and exams begin\n \n \n \n \nWednesday\n11\nJune\nExam contingency afternoon – keep free\nWednesday  \n25\nJune\nExam contingency day – keep free\nThursday\n26\nJune\nLeavers’ Party\n \n￼\n \n \nSafeguarded hours\n \nAs a reminder, updated hours during which the College is a safeguarded site are from 8am to 5pm. This allows us to ensure we have the appropriate level of wrap around care, should a safeguarding incident occur. Students are expected to leave the site by 5pm.  \n \nShould there be a need to stay after 5pm, students must have a staff member who has agreed to take responsibility for them the whole time they are on College site. This staff member will notify the Caretaking team with details of where the students are and inform them when they are leaving. This is so that in the event of a fire or safety incident, we know who is on site and where they are.  \n \nIf you have been supervised by a member of staff after 5pm, please be aware that the access gates will remain closed after college hours. You should therefore leave site via the main reception. \n \n \n￼\n \nWe hope that you enjoyed the Employer Fair. I have no doubt that the employers attending enjoyed meeting you and I do hope that you have found it useful.  \n \nIt’s been lovely to hear about university and apprenticeship offers and gap year plans from Year 13s. Lots of you are still waiting to hear from universities, but they should all reply to you by 14 May. You have, in most cases, until 5 June to reply to your offers. Do look back at the Whole Cohort Presentation ‘Firm and Insurance Choices and Student Finance’ if you need help with this.\n \nIf things haven’t worked out how you hoped they would, or you still need support with your plans, please do get in touch with Careers.\n \nIf you are planning to apply to university in your gap year, keep reading your emails for information on how to do this. Also put 23 June in your diary as the date for the Gap UCAS Registration Day, where we will support you with your plans. Do click on this link to join the Year 13 ‘Gap Year Team’, if you haven’t done so already. \n \nAnd please do ensure that you complete the Year 13 Leavers’ Survey, which you were sent recently. As well as giving us helpful feedback on what we do well and what we can do even better, this is where we can make sure we have an accurate record of your future plans as well as your private email address so that we can get in contact if we need to once your College IT accounts are closed down in the autumn.  \n \n￼\n \nAs we look ahead to the summer term, Hills Road Sixth Form College Performing Arts Department are very excited about next term’s programme of events.\n \nAmerican Psycho – a Musical will be running from 23 to 27 April and Wuthering Heights will run from 25 to 27 June.

They will need to make their end-of-year final declaration using HMRC approved MTD software.\n \nThose impacted by the new legislation will be contacted by HMRC this April, and we are also contacting those clients directly whom we believe are in scope to help assist with getting ready in good time for the change. \n \nIf we have not contacted you directly and you believe that you fall within the scope as outlined above or you receive a letter from HMRC, advising of the changes, please contact us via MakingTaxDigital@azets.co.uk so that we can get in touch to help you.\n \nWhat does the introduction of MTD for Income Tax mean?\nTo comply with the requirements, those affected must:\n	•	keep their records digitally\n	•	submit digital quarterly updates to HMRC\n	•	use MTD-compatible software to file income tax returns\nWe are here to help\nWhere applicable, our dedicated Digital Delivery team is available to assist with:\n	•	Selecting, implementing, and setting up a compliant MTD solution\n	•	Providing ongoing support for a smooth transition\nFor more information on the requirements, including FAQs, click here.\nCONTACT US \n\n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \nAzets Holdings Limited, 2nd Floor, Regis House, 45 King William Street, City of London, London EC4R 9AN, United Kingdom \nUnsubscribe Manage preferences \nCopyright © 2025 Azets, All rights reserved.\nThe information in this email is confidential and may be legally privileged.

There is and will be a lot of press I dare say many of you have read or will be reading, I thought I would give a summary below:\n \nWhat just happened?\n \nPresident Trump has delivered his “Liberation Day” announcement, ending weeks of anticipation and speculation. The measures were toward the more extreme end of expectations. We will try not to reprise what is widely available in the press, but it’s worth a quick reminder on the background behind last night’s executive order.\n \nVery early in his second term, President Trump ordered the US Trade Representative to investigate potential trade frictions imposed by America’s trading partners which might cause their exports to America to be more competitive than America’s exports to them. He asked for it to be a thorough review going beyond tariffs to also include non-tariff barriers.\n \nWhat was announced?\n \nDespite decades of progress in reducing tariffs and trade barriers, there remain frictions and to some extent these are inevitable. \n \n	•	At the end of March, this report was produced and based upon it, the administration has determined that every country exerts protectionist policies which the US needs to reciprocate. That includes 115 countries with an identical implied tariff on US imports of 10% which will be fully reciprocated and 75 countries with implied tariff rates of greater than 10% which will be partially reciprocated with tariffs ranging from 10% to 50%\n	•	This comes after tariffs which President Trump introduced during his first term on China and metal imports. This year he has now raised tariffs in China three more times – reaching a cumulative rate of more than 60%. This includes tariffs related to fentanyl imports which also apply to Canada and Mexico. Sector specific tariffs of 25% have been announced on US imports of steel, aluminium, cars, and car parts.\n	•	The impact of this is significant. The average tariff suffered by US imports has risen by around 20% so far during his second term. He has indicated further tariffs will come to cover pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, and copper.\n \nMarket reaction \n \n	•	Although Tariffs were priced into market to some extent, the level imposed is worse than the market expected. The reaction has been consistent with ongoing concerns that this will dampen growth.\n	•	Equity markets sold off globally.\n \nWhat’s the context? \n \n	•	In the short-term, the tariff news likely could worsen the recent weakness evident in consumer and business confidence. \n	•	Combination of the uncertainty and long-lead times makes it unlikely that corporates would be willing to commit meaningful investment to bring manufacturing back to the US. The US is a high-cost location to manufacture most goods. And there is no certainty of the duration of the current policy.\n	•	Lots of US companies used their pricing power to raise prices during the recent wave of inflation. That was during a time when the US government was handing consumers stimulus cheques and so could afford the higher prices. While some corporates will try to pass on in pricing, it’s not as clear that they will be as successful this time round given the weaker consumer. It's therefore a risk for corporate margins.\n	•	For many non-US companies, the tariffs are a major challenge, not least for European and Asian auto makers which have a 25% tariff imposed from today.\n \nWhat’s next? \n \n	•	It is possible that headline tariff rates are negotiated down in the coming days, ahead of their imposition, and/or over the coming weeks and months. \n \nThere is no question that the impact of these tariffs is negative for the global economy. There are environmental and social consequences of trade, but it is economically positive, and its curtailment is a headwind. He has already signalled his willingness to negotiate, and the unpopularity of prices increases should encourage him to come to the table, so it would not be surprising to see these tariff rates reducing over time in a succession of announcements.\n \nOf course, investing is always fuelled with volatility, appreciate recent periods given pandemics, wars etc have exacerbated that in recent years. This arguably is a follow on from that. We have been in situations like this before and things have and can turn quickly in markets. \n \nIf you have any major concerns or fears, please reach out and we can have a chat.\n \nAll the best,\nGary \n \nGary Edwards, DipPFS, Cert CII (MP) Director\n￼    \nTel: 0207 367 5549 | Mob: 077913 77369 | www.bandefinancial.co.uk\nOffice: 75 King William Street, London, EC4N 7BE\nB&E Financial Limited is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA number: 724525)  \n Registered in England: 09740270.

(Some regular competitive teams have dedicated channels to discuss tactics beforehand) but if you have any questions please ask or DM any Rhino you have spoken with and they will help you or point you in the right direction.\n​\nMake sure you click the RacePass in the team sheet ASAP and are registered for the event. You have to sign up to the RacePass before that TimeZone begins, but so long as you have then you don’t actually have to join the event Race Pen in Zwift up until a few minutes before your official start time. However, it's always recommended to be in the Race Pen and in the Team Voice Channel 5-10 minutes before your start time.\n​\nYou can confirm you’ve signed up correctly using the RacePass, as you should then see the TTT event on the home screen of your Zwift Companion App listed under Events.\nChange kit to the Rhino jersey (if you have it - if you are new it might take a week for Gordon to get it unlocked for you).\n Make sure you select a TT bike from your garage!! If you want to look at the fastest bike setup, try Zwifter Bikes and use the settings to adjust for the course, your Zwift level, your Drops level and FTP and weight etc.\nZWIFTER BIKES\n￼\nAdd (Rhino) after your Zwift name (this can be done in the Companion App settings).\nAt least 10 minutes before your event start time, please log on to Zwift (in case of software updates) and join the Discord Team Voice Channel of the team name you are riding with (Albino, Thundering, Rapids, Nuclear etc) meet your teammates, discuss a plan, make sure everyone is ready etc.\n​\nPlease check your discord if you have not used it before (turn on noise suppression in settings to remove trainer/fan noise).\n​\nThe aim is to stay with the group, always in the draft. If you are stronger rider do more work on the front. If weak just try hang on in the draft. Sometimes a race is just too fast and riders need to be dropped (especially for experienced teams going for the win).\n​\nFor teams of 5 or more, the team time is taken from 4th rider to cross the line. For teams of 3 or 4, it is from the 3rd rider crossing the line.\n​\nDon't feel bad if you get dropped just continue the race at your own pace but please DON'T INTERFERE OR TRY DRAFTING OTHER TEAMS. If another team passes you then it is respectful to ease your power for 10-20s until they are passed and a few seconds clear of you.\n​\nIf you finding that you are not enjoying the TTTs and maybe getting put in a team that drops you each week then please feel free to comment on sign up form – you can ask for an easier ride, a harder ride – we are always flexible to try place riders in a team that suits their needs.\n Communication is key, don’t be afraid to talk to your team even if you are new and learning - if you see the group stretching try call it out when you see gaps of 3-4 meters before it gets to 5+ and out the draft. If you can’t last any longer then tell them you are dropping so that they know to carry on etc.\n​\nWe are all racing to have fun and there are some very experienced TTT riders active in ⁠ttt-chat who are happy to answer any and all questions.\n​\nSupport your teammates and have fun. Remember it’s a Team Time Trial!  \n \nThere are lots of videos in streaming links on the Rhino Racing Discord server to see how a TTT is done if you would like to have a look beforehand.\n​\nWell done on getting to the end of this and remember...

All Sixth Form Colleges, who are still part of the Further Education sector, are due to be inspected as a requirement between September 2022 and September 2025 with an added focus on the skills that we develop in our students that serve to support them well, whatever they choose to do once they leave us.  As you may be aware, 93% of our students choose a university route from Hills Road and the annual data from the Higher Education Statistics Authority (HESA) suggests that the gap between the performance of Hills Road students, once at university, continues to strengthen against all other types of schools and colleges, which is exceptionally pleasing.\n \nIn advance of their visit, Ofsted have asked us to send out their short survey to gather your feedback about your views of the College. We do not see this survey feedback at all. Ofsted collect the feedback anonymously and share it with us as data only. Their survey contains only four questions and no free text box, so it would hopefully be quick to complete and we hope you will have a chance to do that. In the summer term, we will be sending our own College survey to you as parents and carers which will ask you for more in depth feedback about your young person’s experience at Hills Road and will allow for a free text response too. \n \nIn the meantime, however, this is the message and the survey link from Ofsted to gather your views through their four questions. Their message is:\n \n“Ofsted is inspecting your College on 01 April 2025 to 04 April 2025 and would welcome your views. You can do this by completing Ofsted's online parents’ and carers’ questionnaire:   \n \nhttps://ofsted.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/ParentCarer/10325554 \n   \nYour views are important to Ofsted and will help inspectors understand your experiences of the College’s provision. Please take the time to give your views.  \n  \nThe questionnaire will close at 11am on 02 April 2025 to give inspectors time to consider the responses.” \n \nThe survey looks to be very quick to fill in, so I hope as many as possible of you will be able to feedback about your experience as a parent at Hills Road to Ofsted. \n \nMany thanks in advance if you are able to. \n \nBest wishes \n \nJo Trump, on behalf of the whole staff team\n \n\n\n\nPlease consider the environment and don't print this email unless you really need to.\n",    "sending_date_time": "Thursday, 27 March 2025 at 10:41:12"  },  {    "subject": "Save on all Easter Gift Sets until Monday 🥚",    "sender": "Chococo <info@chococo.co.uk>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": "Can't see this email?

We’re sorry for any disruption this has caused for you or your customers. \nThis may have affected delivery to all addresses using Google email services, including Gmail addresses and also those where Google is the email provider behind the scenes but a company email address is used. \nPlease note that emails will show as delivered in FreeAgent regardless of whether or not they have reached the recipient’s inbox, as the recipient’s email provider won’t send an error message if they're marked as spam. \nIf you think that any of the emails sent from your FreeAgent account yesterday or early this morning may have been affected, we recommend that you check with any customers who use Google email services and advise them to check their spam or junk folders. Alternatively, you may wish to consider resending the email as any emails sent from FreeAgent should now be working as normal. And if you use a Google email service, don’t forget to check your own spam folder for any emails from FreeAgent. \nWe’re really sorry if this has caused you any problems and hope this helps explain what’s happened. \n  \n￼\n  \nBest wishes, \nTeam FreeAgent \n  \n￼\n  \n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\n￼\nFreeAgent Central Ltd  One Edinburgh Quay, 133 Fountainbridge,  Edinburgh, EH3 9QG,  Edinburgh \nRegistered in Scotland SC316774  VAT Registration Number 916386308 \n￼\nYou‘re receiving this email because you signed up to use FreeAgent.

The third guide, Isabelle, lives in France so will be making her way north to meet the team in Ouistreham on Friday.\nIf you are handing your bike over in Portsmouth, Tony and Michael would like to meet you at the Travelodge Car Park, Kingston Crescent, North End, Portsmouth PO2 8AB, and will update you of their ETA en route, but they should be there by 4:30pm.\nPlease find their contact details below:\nTony +447730 608045\nMichael +44 7362 360 986\nIsabelle +33 6 73 38 29 60\nFriday\nPlease feel free to contact your guides when you arrive in Ouistreham, they will be around all afternoon and evening on Friday 12th July, staying at the Ibis Styles Hotel. If you are on the Friday morning or afternoon ferry then you should be able to access your bike so that you can check it is all OK and ready to go, the guides will give you a specific time to get in to the bike room. If you are on the Friday overnight ferry you can check your bike when you arrive on Saturday morning. \nSaturday\nEveryone should meet at the Ibis Hotel in Ouistreham on Saturday morning at 8:30 ready to go. If you are staying in the Ibis then you will leave your bags in reception to be loaded into the van.\nM-check\nIt is important to check your bike every day before setting off to ensure that it is in good working order and there are no mechanical or safety issues that need rectifying before you set off. A simple way to do this is by performing a quick M-check on your bike every morning. You can see how to do an M-Check here.\n—\nI hope that your ferry over is fun and it won't be long before you're in France ready to start your epic adventure. You'll soon be in the Channel to Med bubble where you'll have left your normal life behind and enjoy the simplicity of \"Eat. Sleep. Cycle. Repeat\" as you meander your way southwards across the length of France.\n \nYou'll see some fantastic sights, visit some lovely places, see the diversity of Northern France to the Central Massif, Mediterranean and everything in between. At times the weather, terrain and scenery will be just perfect and you'll want to cycle forever whilst you'll have other times when the weather is bad, you're feeling tired, struggling up and hill wondering what the hell you're doing - all part of what will hopefully be an amazing experience for you. You'll meet lots of like-minded people, meet many interesting characters on the road and hopefully have lots of laughs and great memories to cherish.\n \nIt is important to remember to cycle at your own pace. Don't try and keep up with others if they're cycling at a speed that's too fast for you and likewise if you like to go fast then don't feel like you have to wait for others. The important thing is that you cycle safely and enjoy the ride and remember it's a marathon, not a sprint. You'll most likely split into different groups when you're cycling and end up cycling with people of a similar pace or maybe you prefer to cycle on your own, whichever way is fine. Generally all these things will happen naturally and after a few days you'll be into your new routine.\n \nAs the days pass by your day to day routines will become second nature and all you'll be thinking about is enjoying the ride and wondering where the next brew stop is!\n \nEach evening you'll stay in a different town, a different hotel, eat in a different hotel or restaurant and have many stories to share with your new found friends. When you finally reach your finale at the Mediterranean you’ll have mixed emotions of joy and sadness as you'll be overjoyed, having completed (hopefully) an amazing ride but sad that your journey has come to an end.\n \nI truly hope that you have a great time and enjoy your two weeks in France.\n \nI'll wish you a Bon Voyage for now and all the very best for your tour, but if you have any final questions then please do get in touch.\n \nMay the sun shine and the god of tail winds be with you.\n Liz      \n\n-- \n\n\n￼\nPeak Tours\nCycling and Walking Holidays\nphone: +44 (0) 1457 851 462\nmobile: +44 (0) 7495 023 022\nemail: info@peak-tours.com\nRear of 75 Station Rd, Hadfield \nGlossop, Derbyshire SK131DL \n￼￼￼\n-- \n\n\n",    "sending_date_time": "Tuesday, 30 July 2024 at 14:42:09"  },  {    "subject": "Forthcoming rounds of the Junior RR Series",    "sender": "Carole Leigh <caroleleigh62@googlemail.com>",    "recipient": "caroleleigh62@googlemail.com",    "body": "I hope you all enjoyed yesterdays Junior CiCle Classic event, what a fantastic field we had for the race and congratulations on all contributing to a very competitive race, I’m just glad it wasn’t me having to clean your kit!!\nSo onto the next few rounds of the series and a reminder of when their entries close\n14th April         Cadence Junior RR                              entries close 23rd March\n28th April         Tiverton Road Race                             entries close 8th April\n4/5th May        Isle of Man Youth & Junior Tour          entries close 6th April\n \nKind Regards\nCarole \n \nCAROLE LEIGH\nNational Elite Road & Circuit Series Entries & Results Co-ordinator\nChief Judge Junior CiCle Classic & IOM J&T Tour\n \nMob: 07989883378\nEmail: caroleleigh62@googlemail.com\n￼\n \n",    "sending_date_time": "Monday, 18 March 2024 at 17:36:21"  },  {    "subject": "The Haverhill Running Festival is in one month!",    "sender": "HaverSports <haverhalf@mail.mailchimpapp.com>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": "￼ \nThere's just a month to go until the Haverhill Running Festival!\n￼ \nHaverhill Running Festival returns for 2024!  ENTER HERE\n  Hi all, we hope you're enjoying 2024 and your training for the upcoming race year is well underway!  The Haverhill Running Festival is now just a month away Sunday 7 April, with the 10k Haver10, the 13.1-mile HaverHalf - the JMP Furniture Solutions Half Marathon, the full 26.2-mile HaverMara, and the HaverSports Family Fun Run to suit all ages and abilities.  All races will be chip timed and ARC licensed, with medals and goodies for all finishers.  2024 is HaverSports' 10 year anniversary, and we'll be celebrating with a festival atmosphere at the race!

These are by no means obligatory but we have found that people find them a great way to socialise with people that they haven’t necessarily been riding with. We will have group evening meals on the following nights:\nDay 1 - Bagnoles del Orme\nDay 2 - La Flèche. All of the restaurants in La Flèche are closed on Sunday, so one of them opens especially for us but we need a pre-order before we arrive.\nDay 9,  Day 11 (after Mont Ventoux) and Day 14 (these pre-orders will be taken by your guides on tour)\n\nI know it is quite a way off but I would like to ask you for your menu choices for evening 1 and 2. The restaurants like to have them well in advance, and it often takes some time to gather everyone’s choices so I would be grateful if you could take a look at the menus and input your choices by clicking on the following link: July 14 Day Channel to the Med Menu Choices\n\nWe don’t organise any other group meals as it gives people a chance to enjoy and explore each town in the evenings (we will give you a list of suggestions of where to eat), and often the restaurants want a pre-order with group meals so there is less choice. There is a set price for the five x 3 course meals we do have booked: 143 Euros (26+30+30+27+30) - to be paid for by you. Last year we found it easiest to collect this at the start of the tour so that the guides don't have to keep asking you for money (some of the restaurants find it easier to have the cash rather than lots of people all trying to pay by card). \n\nAll lunches will be provided and paid for by Peak Tours except during the Mont Ventoux day. The reason for this is that we like to have both vans supporting you on the mountain and usually the group spreads out a lot, so it is difficult to have guides either setting up a picnic, or being present at a café / restaurant to welcome you. There is a restaurant 4 miles into the descent, Chalet Reynard, that we would recommend you eat at, or alternatively you can have a late lunch after finishing the day in Sault. For this reason, although the cost of the four group evening meals is 143 Euros, we would ask you to bring 130 Euros, rather than 143 Euros, to the main brief at the hotel in Bagnoles del Orme on the first Saturday. Please use the 13 Euros we don’t ask for to cover your lunch on the Mont Ventoux day.\n\nI will be sending you the GPX files and route notes for the tour soon, but I didn't want to bombard you with too many emails today! Thanks to all who have already paid their final balance and filled in the Bike Details for EU Transportation form.\n\nIf you have any queries at all then please don't hesitate to contact me.\n\nMany Thanks\n\nLiz\n\n",    "sending_date_time": "Wednesday, 24 May 2023 at 17:17:36"  },  {    "subject": "Touch Base",    "sender": "Nico Christodoulides <Nico@quintessencemail.com>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": "Hi Roger,\n \nI trust and hope you are well.

So far I see 10 of you signed up - I know we can do better than that! \n\nTomorrow I expect to add the other races we are considering between now and the end of the summer holidays.

In the time I have been coaching the junior squad, we have only had to bar people from racing for non-payment on one occasion, but it is something I am keen to avoid repeating. \n\nHello all, hope your children enjoyed their first race experience at Champs Junior Sculling head a few weekends ago. \n\nWith regards to race fees, these costs are passed on to the athletes and monitored in the race account spreadsheet, found below, in it there is a tab called Juniors and if you scroll along to the right you will (hopefully) find your child. It is ordered alphabetically by surname. \n\nThe club is currently operating a, must have credit in the race account before entries can be made, policy, this will be less strictly enforced for the junior section but please try and keep on top of things. \n\nIf you have any questions or need any guidance/a longer time frame please get in contact with me: \nTom Upton - ccrc.race.entries@gmail.com \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KyeKPiveezQyOOIl6u2v8ryqTLNrs6qe7X8mtRVyspc/edit?usp=sharing \n\nThe race bank account is different from the main club account that memberships are paid to, the race account is: \nname\nCity of Cambridge Rowing Club \naccount no\n36888963\nsort code\n09-01-28\n\nThanks very much \n-- \nTom Upton \n\nEnjoy your last few days of the Easter Break - see you all soon, \nBruce \n\nOn Thu, 6 Apr 2023 at 23:07, CCRC Junior Lead Coach < ccrcjuniorcoach@gmail.com> wrote: \nHappy Easter, everybody.\n\nI wanted to clarify that training takes a pause for the Easter Holidays, and that there is no training this weekend or during the week after (contrary to land training sessions still in Ludum at present - we'll fix that!) \n\nThe weekend at the end of the break, it is not clear whether we will be able to run any water sessions - many of our coaches will be tied up with senior and/or masters training camps. If we are able to put anything on, I will make sure a post goes out on Ludum so that you get a chance to sign up. \n\nMeanwhile I would like to draw your attention to the Ball Cup on 7th May. This is a wonderful event aimed specifically at smaller clubs. As such it may be the last year we are eligible as we grow the junior squad, so I'd love it if we can hit it in style this year, including entries in the actual Ball Cup events (coxed fours). Entries close 20th April so please get your availability set as soon as possible and definitely no later than next Friday. (Note that, since this is a British Rowing event, you will need BR membership. This is £30 for the year for juniors; you can get it set up very quickly if down to be entered, but that will need to be done before we can submit entries.) \n\nSee you all in a week or so when we get back into the swing of training, \nBruce \n",    "sending_date_time": "Thursday, 13 April 2023 at 07:46:28"  },  {    "subject": "Your subscription for donan.uk will renew on 23 April 2023",    "sender": "Shopify Billing <billing@shopify.com>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": "\nYour annual Shopify subscription for Donan Cleaning Products is scheduled to renew on 23 April 2023.

Conditions were variable through the day, but challenging throughout! All crews showed true grit in pushing their boats all the way to the finish. Times are below, along with other boats in your category where we had any competition.\n\nAcross the rest of the club, it was a good day with wins in several categories and the fastest women's 8+ in the whole event.\n\nPosition\nCategory\nName\nJan End\n1\nMixed Junior J14 2x\nCAM-MxJ14 2x\n17:42.3\n1\nOpen Junior J14 2x\nCAM-OJ14 2x\n15:52.2\n1\nOpen Junior J16 2x\nCAM-OJ16 2x\n15:27.3\n1\nWomen's Junior J14/15 2x\nSt Mary's - Year 9 \n14:20.7\n2\nWomen's Junior J14/15 2x\nCAM-WJ15 2x\n15:11.6\n3\nWomen's Junior J14/15 2x\nShepherd\n00:00.0\n4\nWomen's Junior J14/15 2x\nMonteith\n00:00.0\n1\nWomen's Junior J16 4x-\nSt Mary's - Year 11\n14:09.2\n2\nWomen's Junior J16 4x-\nCAM-WJ16 4x\n15:05.7\n\nLooking ahead, I have added the following race events to Ludum. Note that the list includes events which the whole squad could potentially enter. If you see it on Ludum then set your availability and the coaches will select crews based on that, plus an assessment of your ability nearer the time. Apart from Champs Junior Sculling Head, you will need a BR race license to enter these events, which can usually be sorted quite quickly.\n\nFeb.4 - Peterborough Head of the Nene\nThis one is very much for the more experienced members (and is only J15+ anyway) since it is not as easy to follow crews by bike as it is on the Cam. 2.6km of pretty straight river.\n\nMar 12 - Easter Region JIRR trials\nJIRR stands Junior Inter-Regional Regatta. This is the session where the Eastern Region clubs compete to represent the region in the national event at the National Water Sports Centre (Nottingham) on April 22nd. J14-J16, but good J13s can race up as J14. (Note that, annoyingly, this clashes with the final leg of the Winter League, so some rowers may need to make a choice between events.)\n\nMar 18 (provisional) - Champs Junior Sculling head\nThis is a great first head racing experience for many, as it's a relatively short 1450m course on the Cam.\n\nMar 20 - Oarsport Junior Sculling Head\nAlthough a head race, this takes place on the rowing lake near Windsor. It is therefore a great experience for those who have progressed enough in their age category (J14-J17). Note that it's a school day, though we expect most schools would accept competing in this event to be a sufficiently educational activity to allow the day out of school. We will consider availability (rowers and coaches!) and abilities very carefully before committing to going. Also it's 4x (and 8x) only, so we will need sufficient availability for a given category in order to enter crews.\n\nPlease set your availability for this one based on whether you are willing, and think you would probably be able, to take the day off school if selected for a crew.\n\nBruce\n-- \nCCRC Junior Lead Coach\n\nRace Account\n",    "sending_date_time": "Wednesday, 18 January 2023 at 08:00:30"  },  {    "subject": "Fwd: Proud of Teachers 💜 £300 off - TUI | 20% off - JD Sports",    "sender": "Claire Pembery <claire@pembery.com>",    "recipient": "roger@pembery.com",    "body": "Fyi\nOn 7 Jan 2023, at 14:11, Discounts For Teachers <dft@dft.discountsforteachers.co.uk> wrote:\n￼\n\n￼\n￼\nView in browser \nToday's top discounts... \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \nJD Sports \nboohoo \nLove Holidays \nPandora \n20% Teachers discount \nup to 70% off + extra 10% Teachers discount \nup to an extra 15% off selected hotels + £25 extra Teachers discount \nExclusive 10% Teachers discount \nGet code \nGet code \nGet code \nGet code \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \nLes Mills \nJet2holidays \nSephora \nVirgin Holidays \n30 days FREE + Teachers save 25% a month \n£25 Teachers discount \n20% Teachers discount \nsave up to 10% \nGet deal \nGet code \nGet code \nGet deal \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \nFitFlop \nShark Clean \nHoliday Hypermarket \neasyJet Holidays \nup to 50% off + an extra 15% Teachers discount on all footwear \n10% Teachers discount \nsave up to £250 on summer 2023 + extra £25 Teachers discount \nsave up to £300 + Teachers get an extra £25 e-gift card on all holiday bookings \nGet code \nGet code \nGet deal \nGet code \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \nMountain Warehouse \nTUI \nAA Breakdown \nThe North Face \n10% off everything for Teachers \nsave an extra £300 per booking \nfrom £4.55 per month* for Teachers \nup to 40% off \nGet code \nGet deal \nGet deal \nGet deal \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \nAirport Parking and Hotels \nReassured \nJoules \nThomas Cook \nup to 70% off + 20% extra Teachers discount at major airports \nfree quote + Teachers save up to £1,188* \n20% Teachers discount \nExclusive £25 Teachers discount \nGet deal \nGet deal \nGet code \nGet code \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \nBooking .com \nBT \nSchuh \nEurocamp \n15% or more off selected properties \nFirst 6 months half price + £100 virtual reward card \nup to 70% off \nup to 50% Teachers discount \nGet deal \nGet deal \nGet deal \nGet code \n￼ \n￼ \n￼\n📣 Refer a Friend - Help us to help others! >>> \n\nPlease share with colleagues who may not know about this scheme \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \n￼ \nAll offers correct at time of publishing.

I feel that it is prudent to at least review the risks of the additional work. Without getting a tape-measure out, they are within 12 inches of the boundary and about 4 feet deep. I am concerned that the actual work being done is not in accordance to what the owner nor the main contractor were lead to believe, which leads me to assume that sufficient planning may not be undertaken, leading to additional risk.\n \nCan you let me know what you advise? \n \nKind regards,\n \nRoger.\n \nFrom: Christopher Church <christopherchurch74@yahoo.co.uk>  Sent: 06 December 2022 16:06 To: Roger Pembery <roger@pembery.com> Cc: 'Phil Ward' <philipward@argyledesign.co.uk>; g.voyias@ashtonce.co.uk; 'Brian Pope' <fampope83@gmail.com> Subject: Re: Some digging at 85 Gilbert on Tuesday\n \nHi Roger,\n \nSorry to hear this.

As far as I was made aware they'd be digging up my driveway, not yours.\n \nI do have a copy of the Anglian permission and the Section 50 licence - attached here for your reference.  Fun fact: we originally applied back in July. You'll notice the 23rd Sept as the application date to the council.

The Bicycle Ambulance will be open from around 9am where you will be able to sign on. We will be heading off between 9:30-10am but feel free to head out once you have signed up and filled in a few details.\nThere are two different routes for you to choose from depending on the distance you want to cover. Both the 75km and 100km have a good mixture of surfaces, pub stops and cafes to refuel.\nHere are the links to the two distances.\nhttps://ridewithgps.com/trips/94908069\nhttps://ridewithgps.com/trips/94908094\nHaving tested the route two weeks ago it was dry and very compact. Various sections had become overgrown so expect a little hike-a-bike. Make sure you have everything you need should you have any issues as a couple of sections are in the middle of nowhere and hard to get to.\nIf the weather is as hot as last year then please make sure you have plenty of water. There are shops on-route to stock up should you need water etc.\nIf you have ordered the t-shirt please can you let us know what size? These should be back from the printers on Friday but if they don't turn up in time please let us know your address on Saturday to post them out to you.\nThere are a couple of people who have asked about camping. There are a few campsites we know of in Cambridge but here is a link to Pitchup where you can find more.\nThanks once again for signing up and we look forward to meeting faces both old and new on Saturday.\nAll the best,\nRichard, Claire, Sam & Rick\n \nDetails to remember.\nLeave the meeting point any time you like before 10am.\nIt’ll take you at least 6 hours (depending on how fit you are) especially if stopping more than once so make sure you have everything you need.\nBring your buddies, it’s not a big group ride, it’s not a lead ride, you will need your own navigation. Do not expect to be able to turn up and just follow someone around.\nThere has been a lot of storm damage in the woods so tree felling has been on-going....watch out! There have been a few cases of falling branches but felling rarely happens at weekends.\nWe have ridden the route several times and have had no issues with shared paths and bridleways. There are some sections of hike-a-bike on footpaths, so smile, say thank you and giving people space normally goes a long way.\nGo at your own pace, enjoy it. This is a social ride and a great place to meet up with like-minded people. When you are back at the shop we hope to hear about your day over a beer and some food.\nPlease wear a helmet! Some of the route is very tricky and we wouldn't want anyone to have an accident.\nDisclaimer!\nAs with each route we publish, if you choose to cycle this route, do so at your own risk. Prior to setting out, check current local weather, conditions, and land/road closures. While riding, obey all public and private land use restrictions and rules, carry proper safety and navigational equipment, and of course, follow the #leavenotrace guidelines.
